If desired, they can use this simple procedure to validate the problems from their assignments or projects from class.\n\n1.3 Introduction to the Problem\n\nThis example is from Chapter 17 – Plane Motion of Rigid Bodies: Energy and Momentum Methods. Some theoretical explanations in this tutorial assumes that the reader has an understanding of some basics of Vector Mechanics.\n\nFigure 1: Example 17.18\n\nIn this particular example, we have a rigid body – slender rod – positioned in the vertical position as shown in the above image. There is a spring with a spring constant k, one end of which is fixed at point D and the other end is attached to the lower end (C) of the rod. The rod is pivoted at a point B which is along the length of the rod. All the required parameters are provided in the question. The objective of the problem is to calculate the angular velocity of rod after it has rotated through 90 degrees.\n\nFigure 2: Amesim schematic of Example 17.8\n\nSketch Mode/Step 1\n\nFigure 3: Sketch mode icon\n\nWhenever we fire up Amesim, we start off in the Sketch mode by default.\n\nFigure 4: Planar Mechanical Library\n\nNow, from the Library tree on the right side of your screen, find and double-click on the ‘Planar Mechanical’ library.\n\nThen, the Planar Mechanical library will open up and you will be able to see all of its components.\n\nFigure 5: Components of the planar mechanical library\n\nNow, we proceed to sketch our model. To do this, we need bring all the necessary components to our sketch area. We can do this in two ways:\n\nDrag and drop\nClick on the component once, move your cursor onto the sketch area and place it by clicking again. \n\nYou will see a sketch similar to the following image. The numbers on the either side of the component block are its ports. More about ports later.\n\nFigure 6: Adding components to the sketch\n\nFollow the same procedure to bring all the necessary components into the sketch area. The following components are required to complete this example:\n\n2 x end restraint\n1 x pivot junction\n1 x N port body (one port on the left and one port on the right) \n1 x zero force source \n1 x zero speed source (from Mechanical library) \n1 x spring (from Mechanical library)\n\nFigure 7: Components required from the Planar Mechanical library\n\nFigure 8: Components required from the Mechanical library\n\nAfter you complete importing all the required components to your sketch it should look like this:\n\nFigure 9: All the components in the sketch before making the connections\n\nNow, we need to make the connections. To do this click near the port of one component to see your cursor turn to a black plus symbol. Now you should be able to see a green dot-dashed line following your cursor. Move your cursor close to the port of the component to which you want to connect your first component until you see a green square appear. Then, click again. Now, both the components are connected together. Follow the same procedure to connect all the components. At the end of it, your sketch should look like this:\n\nFigure 10: Sketch after completing the connections\n\nYou can always drag any component to rearrange your sketch. Note that you cannot rotate or flip (Ctrl + M) your components after making the connections.\n\nFigure 11: Rearranging your components\n\nFigure 12: Auxiliary components required\n\nNow, our sketch is ready. Using Ctrl+S, save the file to a local drive and make sure that the file name does not have any spaces, and it should also not start with a number. Before we windup our sketch, we need two more supplementary components which are not a part of our problem, but are necessary for our simulation. Those are the assembly component from the Planar mechanical library and the gravity icon from the Mechanical library.\n\nSub-model Mode/ Step2\n\nFigure 13: Sub-model mode icon\n\nAfter completing the assembly of our components, the next step in building our model is the Sub-model mode. \n\nAfter we switch to this mode, we will see that some components get highlighted. This means that those components have multiple sub-models from which we can select one. By selecting different sub-models, we are choosing a more complex mathematical representation of the same component.\n\nFigure 14: Highlighted components in sub-model mode\n\nWe can see the list of sub-models of a particular component by double-clicking on the highlighted component.\n\nFigure 15: List of sub-models available for any component\n\nFigure 16: Premier sub-model icon\n\nHere, we can see that the pivot junction component has two sub-models. Generally, the sub-models are listed in the order of increasing complexity i.e. PLMPIV01 is more complex than PLMPIV00. If we just want all the simplest mathematical models for all the components which have multiple sub-models, we can do so by directly selecting the Premier Sub-model option.\n\nParametric Mode/ Step3\n\nFigure 17: Parametric mode icon\n\nNow that we have defined how each component is mathematically represented, the next step is to define the parameters of each component. We do this in the Parametric mode. \n\nParameters of every component can be seen on the right hand side of the screen, after clicking on the component of interest. In the following image we can see the parameters of the end restraint component. For the problem of interest, we do not change any of these parameters for the end restraint (B) as we want the end restraint to serve as the origin, relative to which we will define the positions of all the components connected to it.\n\nFigure 18: Parameters of the end restraint\n\nNext, we set the parameters for the pivot junction. Ideally, a pivot should not have any stiffness or damping associated with it. So, to make things simple when we try to validate our simulations with hand-written solutions, it is better to set these parameters to 0. Make sure to do this for both the pivot junctions.\n\nFigure 19: Parameters of the pivot junction\n\nThen, we have to define the parameters of the PLM body-1. Whenever dealing with most of the components in the Planar mechanical library, it is important to visualize these components in a coordinate plane, and the parameters that we set will define their position in that coordinate plane. In the current problem, we have our origin at point B or the connection between the end restraint and the pivot. So, we need to define the positions of the ends A and C of the rod, and also the position of the center of gravity with respect to point B.\n\nThe following are the parameters related to the rod in our problem:\n\nFigure 20: All parameters in the problem\n\nFigure 21: Coordinates of various points\n\nAs we can see in the table above, there is no change in the x coordinate of any point. This is because the rod is in the vertical position, so all the points on the rod are on the same vertical line. Also, the y coordinate of point C is negative because it is lower than our origin point B.\n\nFollowing the formula for Moment of inertia of a rod, we can set the parameter ‘moment of inertia around Gz axis'\n\nFigure 22: Parameters of the PLM body\n\nSimulation Mode/ Step4\n\nFigure 23: Simulation mode icon\n\nAt this stage, we have built our sketch, chose the mathematical representation of the components, and finally defined the parameters of all the components. Next step is to run the simulation.\n\nAs soon as we click on the simulation mode button, Amesim compiles the model that we have built and creates a simulation program\n\nFigure 24: System compilation window\n\nIf we have built our model correctly, then we will see the ‘Completed’ message after system compilation. \n\nFigure 25: Run parameters and Start simulation icon\n\nWe can change the parameters of our simulation, by clicking on the ‘Run parameters’ button \n\nFigure 26: Run parameters window\n\nFor the example in consideration, we need not change any of these parameters. Then, we click on the ‘Start simulation’ button to run the model. If we haven’t made any mistakes in building our model, then the simulation will run to 100% without any errors.\n\nFigure 27: Successful simulation\n\nVisualizing Results/ Step5\n\nNow that we have successfully run our simulation without any errors, it is time to visualize and analyze the parameters of interest. The outputs/variables of any component can be seen on the right, bottom corner of the screen. \n\nFigure 28: Variables/Outputs of the PLM body\n\nBecause we want the angular velocity of the rod when it has rotated through 90o, we need to plot angular velocity vs angular position.\n\nTo do that, first we need to plot the angular velocity and the angular position on the same figure.\n\nIn Amesim, plotting any result is as easy as a drag and drop. Click on Body-1 to display its variables. Now, click on ‘absolute angular position’ and drag it on to the sketch and release the mouse button.\n\nNow, we will be able to see a plot of ‘absolute angular position [degree] vs Time [s]’ \n\nFigure 29: Absolute angular position of PLM body vs Time\n\nYou can follow the same procedure to plot any variable of any component in your model. Remember that Amesim plots any variable of interest against the axis of time.\n\nNow, follow the same procedure to plot ‘absolute angular velocity’ variable. But, this time, drag and drop on the already existing plot (Plot-1: absolute angular position).\n\nYou should get a plot similar to the one below.\n\nFigure 30: Plotting angular velocity and angular position on the same figure\n\nFigure 31: Converting two curves into one curve\n\nAt the top right corner of the figure, we have an option which will convert two curves, which are two variables each against time, into a single curve with the two curves plotted against each other. After selecting that option, click anywhere on the figure and you should see the final plot like the image below. \n\nFigure 32: Angular velocity vs angular position\n\nUsing the ‘Show XY coordinates’ option, we get a cursor to visualize the Y coordinate at every X coordinate.\n\nFigure 33: Show coordinates cursor option\n\nBecause we need to calculate the angular velocity at angular position = 90o, use the cursor to navigate to the point where ‘x_1’ is 90o.\n\nThen, we can see that the value of angular velocity to be around 11.53 rad/s\n\nFigure 34: Angular velocity at angular position 90o\n\nFigure 35: PLM Assembly icon\n\nThe theoretical solution from the text is 11.52 rad/s\n\nThere is one feature in Amesim which is specific to the Planar mechanical library: PLM-Assembly. In any other library, we can visualize the functioning of our system by building a 3d representation using Amesim’s Animation feature, but the PLM-Assembly block automatically builds the animation using the parameters that we set. You can open the animation by double-clicking on the PLM-Assembly component.\n\nFigure 36: Interface of the PLM assembly animation window\n\nHere, you can see that all the components that we had used to build our model have been represented in the animation.\n\nYou can click on the play button on top of the animation window to visualize the functioning of our double pendulum system.\n\n\nExample By: Sai Krishna Sumanth Nakka"

The system consists of two rigid bodies connected via a pivot junction. One node of one of the bodies is connected to a fixed pivot junction while one end of the other body is a free end. After releasing the system from an initial position, the two bodies move about their respective pivots under the influence of gravitational force. \n\n1. Sketch Mode\n\nWhenever we fire up Amesim, we start off in the Sketch mode by default.\n\n\n \n\nNow, from the Library tree on the right side of your screen, find and double-click on the ‘Planar Mechanical’ library.\n\nFigure 2: Planar Mechanical Library\n\nThen, the Planar Mechanical library will open up and you will be able to see all of its components. \n\nFigure 3: Components of the planar mechanical library\n\nTo know what each component is, hover your mouse cursor over the component for a couple of seconds \n\nFigure 4: Revealing the name of any component; Pivot junction\n\nAnd to know more about any component, right-click on the component and click on ‘Help’\n\nFigure 5: Using the 'Help' option to know more about each component\n\nNow, we proceed to sketch our model. To do this, we need bring all the necessary components to our sketch area. We can do this in two ways:\n\nDrag and drop\nClick on the component once, move your cursor onto the sketch area and place it by clicking again.\n\nYou will see a sketch similar to the following image. The numbers on the either side of the component block are its ports. More about ports later.\n\nFigure 6: Adding components to the sketch\n\nNow, we proceed to sketch our model. To do this, we need bring all the necessary components to our sketch area. We can do this in two ways:\n\nDrag and drop\nClick on the component once, move your cursor onto the sketch area and place it by clicking again.\n\nYou will see a sketch similar to the following image. The numbers on the either side of the component block are its ports. More about ports later.\n\nFigure 7: Components required to complete this example\n\nAfter you complete importing all the required components to your sketch it should look like this:\n\nFigure 8: All the components in the sketch before making the connections\n\nBefore connecting all our components, which ports of each component needs to be connected to another component. So, it is always a good convention to make sure that the output port number is greater than that of the input. And because the end restraint is the only fixed component in the sketch, we can start from there.\n\nSo, we want the output of the end restraint to be connected to the input of the pivot junction. We can always rotate a component by using the Ctrl + R shortcut. Then, arrange your components such that input port number is 1.\n\nNow, we need to make the connections. To do this click near the port of one component to see your cursor turn to a black plus symbol. Now you should be able to see a green dot-dashed line following your cursor. Move your cursor close to the port of the component to which you want to connect your first component until you see a green square appear. Then, click again. Now, both the components are connected together. Follow the same procedure to connect all the components. \n\nFigure 9: Port numbers of a component and making connections\n\nAt the end of it, your sketch should look like this:\n\nFigure 10: Sketch after completing the connections\n\nYou can always drag any component to rearrange your sketch. Note that you cannot rotate or flip (Ctrl + M) your components after making the connections.\n\nFigure 11: Rearranging your components\n\nNow, our sketch is ready. Using Ctrl+S, save the file to a local drive and make sure that the file name does not have any spaces, and it should also not start with a number.\n\nBefore we windup our sketch, we need two more supplementary components which are not a part of our problem, but are necessary for our simulation. Those are the assembly component from the Planar mechanical library and the gravity icon from the Mechanical library.\n\n\nFigure 12: Auxiliary components required\n\nFigure 12: Auxiliary components required\n\n2. Sub-model Mode/ Step2\n\nAfter completing the assembly of our components, the next step in building our model is the Sub-model mode. \n\nAfter we switch to this mode, we will see that some components get highlighted. This means that those components have multiple sub-models from which we can select one. By selecting different sub-models, we are choosing a more complex mathematical representation of the same component.\n\nFigure 13: Highlighted components in sub-model mode\n\nWe can see the list of sub-models of a particular component by double-clicking on the highlighted component.\n\nFigure 14: List of sub-models available for any component\n\nHere, we can see that the pivot junction component has two sub-models. Generally, the sub-models are listed in the order of increasing complexity i.e. PLMPIV01 is more complex than PLMPIV00.\n\nIf we just want all the simplest mathematical models for all the components which have multiple sub-models, we can do so by directly selecting the Premier Sub-model option.\n\n3. Parametric Mode/ Step3\n\nNow that we have defined how each component is mathematically represented, the next step is to define the parameters of each component. We do this in the Parametric mode. \n\nParameters of every component can be seen on the right hand side of the screen, after clicking on the component of interest. In the following image we can see the parameters of the end restraint component.\n\nFor the problem of interest, we do not change any of these parameters as we want the end restraint to serve as the origin, relative to which we will define the components connected to it. \n\nFigure 15: Parameters of the end restraint\n\nNext, we set the parameters for the pivot junction. Ideally, a pivot should not have any stiffness or damping associated with it. So, to make things simple when we try to validate our simulations with hand-written solutions, it is better to set these parameters to 0. Make sure to do this for both the pivot junctions. \n\nFigure 16: Parameters of the pivot junction\n\nThen, we have to define the parameters of the PLM body-1. Whenever dealing with most of the components in the Planar mechanical library, it is important to visualize these components in a coordinate plane, and the parameters that we set will define their position in that coordinate plane.\n\nLet the following be the parameters for the two bodies in our problem\n\nThe magnitude of each parameter in the problem\n\nParameter\n\n\t\n\nMagnitude\n\n\n\n\nLength of body-1\n\n\t\n\n1 m\n\n\n\n\nMass of body-1\n\n\t\n\n1 kg\n\n\n\n\nOrientation of body-1\n\n\t\n\n00\n\n\n\n\nLength of body-2\n\n\t\n\n1 m\n\n\n\n\nMass of body-2\n\n\t\n\n1.5 kg\n\n\n\n\nOrientation of body-2\n\n\t\n\n300\n\nBecause the length of our Body-1 is 1 m, the parameter ‘x position at port 2’ should be set to 1 m. This is because port 1 is attached to the pivot which in turn is attached to the end restraint (our origin), so naturally port 2 should be the length of the body. As a consequence, the center of gravity parameter ‘G: initial relative x position’ should be 0.5, assuming that our body is uniformly distributed.\n\nFollowing the formula, , for Moment of inertia of a rod, we can set the parameter ‘moment of inertia around Gz axis’\n\nFigure 17: Parameters of the PLM body\n\nNow, we need to follow the same procedure to set the parameters for our Body-2. Before we do that, we need to look at another parameter: coordinates reference. If this parameter is set to relative, then it means that the coordinates for this particular body need not be calculated from the origin. In this case, port 1, becomes the new origin and so the parameters of the body can be set in the same manner as we did for Body-1. If we have the ‘coordinates reference’ as absolute, the x position at port 1 will be 1 m and x position at port 2 will be 2 m.\n\nFigure 18: Coordinates reference parameter of PLM body\n\n4. Simulation Mode/ Step4\n\nAt this stage, we have built our sketch, chose the mathematical representation of the components, and finally defined the parameters of all the components. Next step is to run the simulation.\n\nAs soon as we click on the simulation mode button, Amesim compiles the model that we have built and creates a simulation program\n\nFigure 19: System compilation window\n\nIf we have built our model correctly, then we will see the ‘Completed’ message after system compilation. \n\nWe can change the parameters of our simulation, by clicking on the ‘Run parameters’ button \n\nFigure 20: Run parameters window\n\nFor the example in consideration, we need not change any of these parameters.\n\nThen, we click on the ‘Start simulation’ button to run the model.\n\nIf we haven’t made any mistakes in building our model, then the simulation will run to 100% without any errors. \n\nFigure 21: Successful simulation\n\n5. Visualizing Results\n\nNow that we have successfully run our simulation without any errors, it is time to visualize and analyze the parameters of interest. The outputs/variables of any component can be seen on the right, bottom corner of the screen. \n\nFigure 22: Variables/Outputs of the PLM body-2\n\nSuppose we want to visualize how the angular position of Body-2 has changed over time, we need to plot it.\n\nIn Amesim, plotting any result is as easy as a drag and drop. Click on Body-2 to display its variables. Now, click on ‘absolute angular position’ and drag it on to the sketch and release the mouse button.\n\nNow, we will be able to see a plot of ‘absolute angular position [degree] vs Time [s]’ \n\nFigure 23: Absolute angular position of PLM body-2 vs Time\n\nYou can follow the same procedure to plot any variable of any component in your model.\n\nThere is one feature in Amesim which is specific to the Planar mechanical library: PLM-Assembly. In any other library, we can visualize the functioning of our system by building a 3d representation using Amesim’s Animation feature, but the PLM-Assembly block automatically builds the animation using the parameters that we set. \n\nYou can open the animation by double-clicking on the PLM-Assembly component.\n\n\nFigure 24: Interface of the PLM assembly animation window\n\nHere, you can see that all the components that we had used to build our model have been represented in the animation.\n\nYou can click on the play button on top of the animation window to visualize the functioning of our double pendulum system.\n\nExample By: Sai Krishna Sumanth Nakka\n"

The beam is carrying a uniformly distributed transverse shear load of 5 KN/m. The material properties used are: Elastic modulus (E) = 200 GPa and Poisson ratio (ν) = 0.3.\n\n\nThe Model specifications are as below: The length of the beam is 6 m, width of 250 mm and height of 350 mm.\n\nThe video below contains the description about the problem introduction, model description (geometry, material, loads and constraints), analytical calculations and the expected results.\n\n\nLearning outcome and Output requests\n\nThis example is an introduction of how to model 1D beam element problems in NX Nastran. Solving this problem in NX Nastran, we will be able to find the location of maximum bending moment and thus the maximum bending stress in the beam. We can see how the bending stress is distributed along the beam cross section i.e. locations of tensions and compression.\n\nAlso we can identify the beam deflection at any location in the beam along with shear force and bending moment graphs in the results.\n\nThe following will be requested as output:\n\nReaction forces at supports\nShear force distribution\nBending moment distribution\nBeam deflection\nBending stress\nAnalytical results\n\nLet’s calculate the reaction forces, maximum values of shear force and bending moment, maximum deflection and maximum bending stress in the beam so that we can compare them with the results given by NX Nastran.\n\nNote: The beam deflection and bending stress is calculated using Euler Bernoulli beam theory therefore deflection and stress are calculated considering bending moment only and not shear force.\n\nReaction forces\nShear force distribution\nBending moment distribution\nBeam Deflection & Bending Stress\nSteps\nCAD Modeling\nMeshing and Material\nLoading and Boundary Conditions\nResults post processing\nResults verification and validation\nCAD Modeling\n\nThe first step of simulation is to create a CAD model using NX 12.0. The CAD model for this problem consists of only a line representing the neutral axis of the beam. The video below describes the following operations:\n\nCreating a new part file\nCreating a sketch\nSketch dimensioning\nMeshing and Material\n\nNext step is to create a Fem file. Fem file consists of information regarding the material properties and type of meshing to be done.\n\nThe video below describes the following operations:\n\nCreating fem and sim files\nSolver and solution type\nOutput requests\nMaterial properties\nBeam properties: Material properties and beam cross section\nMeshing info: Element type and size\nLoading and Boundary conditions\n\nNext step is to create a sim file. Sim file consists of information about the loading and constraints to be applied. It also has information about any contacts defined in the model.\n\nThe video below describes the following operations:\n\nUser defined constraints: constraining dof at two ends\nLoading applied: Pressure on beams\nModel setup check\nSolve the Fem model\nCheck for any errors or warnings in Analysis job information\nResults post processing\n\nAfter the solution is done, a result file is created that has all the output results requested. Nastran will always calculate displacement and stress as default, other output parameters are to be predefined.\n\nThe video below describes the following post processing operations:\n\nContour plots of reaction force, shear force and bending moment distribution\nGraph of Shear force distribution in the beam\nContour plot of beam deflection and bending stress\nCross section view of bending stress\nIdentify results at any specific node and nodes having max and min values\nResults verification and validation\n\nSince we now have both the analytical and simulation results, we can easily cross check both the results to see how close the results are given by NX Nastran in comparison to the analytical results. We will also see that the results are independent of the mesh.\n\nNote that the analytical results are calculated using Euler Bernoulli beam theory. NX Nastran uses Timoshenko beam theory by default. So, the magnitude for beam deflection and bending stress might be slightly different in both the cases.\n\nThe video below describes the following operations:\n\nComparison of analytical Vs Fem results for: Reaction force, max. shear force and bending moment, max. values of beam deflection and bending stress\nError calculation between analytical and Fem results\nMesh independence of results\n\nReference: Mechanics of materials by R.C.

The expansion chamber is used to attenuate noises. By using harmonic analysis in NX Nastran, sound pressure in the chamber can be calculated. Based on the sound pressure at the inlet and outlet of the chamber, transmission loss of the chamber can be calculated to investigate the performance of the chamber. In addition, the muffler structure and acoustic cavity interact with each other, therefore the muffler is not effective to reduce noise level at the natural frequencies of both the muffler structure and acoustic cavity.\n\n\nSteps\nCreate FEM File\nLoad Geometry\nGeometry Preparation\nCreate Microphones\nCreate Mesh\nAssign Materials\nCreate SIM file\nSolution setup\nBoundary Condition\nSolve FEM Model\nPost Processing\nCreate FEM File\n\nFigure 1\n\nClick “New” to create simulation from the upper menu bar as shown Figure 1.\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nCheck “NX Nastran Vibro-Acoustic, Type: Fem” and set file name and folder as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nLoad Geometry\n\nFigure 3\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, load CAD file (muffler.prt).\n\n\nGeometry Preparation\n\nFigure 4\n\nFrom the Simulation File View, right-click and left-click “Make Displayed Part, and then click “Promote” from the Start menu as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\nFigure 5\n\nNow, select a whole geometry of the muffler structure as shown in Figure 5, and then click “OK”.\n\n\nFigure 6\n\nClick “Midsurface by Face Pairs” from the “Geometry Preparation” tab as shown in Figure 6.\n\n\nFigure 7\n\nAnd then, as shown in Figure 7, set the properties of “Midsurface by Face Pairs” tab to create shell structure from the solid model of the muffle.\n\n\nFigure 8\n\nNow, you can see the mid-surfaces created that appear in model tree as shown in Figure 8.\n\n\nFigure 9\n\nIn order to create acoustic medium, we have to remove holes from the structure, which are an inlet and outlet of the muffler. Click Geometry Preparation → More → Bounded Plane as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\nFigure 10\n\nClick the curve of the inlet as shown in Figure 10, and click apply. We can see that the inlet is closed by surface. Repeat this for the outlet.\n\n\nFigure 11\n\nAfter removing all holes from the structure, we can create a volume of acoustic medium by using “Surface Wrap Recipe”. First, deactivate polygon body (3D) as shown in Figure 11.\n\n\nFigure 12\n\nThen, click Surface Wrap, Surface Wrap Recipe as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\nFigure 13\n\nFrom the property window of the Surface Wrap Recipe, select all polygon geometry (2D), set Global Resolution as 5 mm, set type of Surface Wrap Interior/Exterior as “Interior Point”, and then select any point inside of the muffler as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\nFigure 14\n\nFrom the model tree, click Surface Wrap Recipes, Surface_Wrap_Recipe1, Wrap as shown in Figure 14.\n\n\nFigure 15\n\nFrom the model tree, activate only Surface Wrap Body (Figure 15).\n\n\nFigure 16\n\nYou can see the volume of the acoustic medium (Figure 16).\n\n\nCreate Microphones\n\nFigure 17\n\nClick Nodes and Elements, Elements, More, Point Set as shown in Figure 17. Point Set Mech Primitives window is opened and add 3 microphones as shown in Figure 18.\n\n\nReplace with your text\nReplace with your text\n\nFigure 18\n\nAnd then we can see 3 microphones inside of the muffler as shown in Figure 19.\n\n\nFigure 19\n\nCreate Mesh\n\nFigure 20\n\nTo create mesh of the acoustic medium, click “3D Tetrahedral” (Figure 20).\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 21, select the volume of the acoustic medium, and set the properties.\n\n\nFigure 21\n\nFigure 22\n\nNow we can see the mesh created for acoustic medium shown in Figure 22.\n\n\nFigure 23\n\nNow, we will create 2D mesh for the muffler structure. First, from the model tree, activate only muffler structures (2D) and exclude surfaces of holes as shown in Figure 23.\n\n\nClick “2D Mesh” from the Mesh tab as shown in Figure 24.\n\nFigure 24\n\nFrom the property window, set the properties for 2D mesh as shown in Figure 25 and click OK.\n\n\nFigure 25\n\nFigure 26\n\nWe can 2D mesh for muffler structure as shown in Figure 26.\n\n\nAssign Materials\n\nFrom the model tree, right-click Acoustic Fluid (1) and click Edit. As shown in Figure 27, set the parameters as shown below:\n\n\nMesh Collector\nType: PSOLID – Acoustic Fluid\nAcoustic Fluid Property: Click Option\nPSOLD – Acoustic Fluid\nName: Set name of the material\nProperties: Click “Create Material”\nMaterial List\nClick “Create Material”\n\nFluid Material\nDensity (RHO): 1.225 kg/m3\nSpeed of Sound (C): 340 m/s\n\nFigure 27\n\nSimilarly, set the material of the muffler structure as aluminum as shown in Figure 28.\n\n\nFigure 28\n\nCreate SIM File\n\nFrom the model tree, right-click on fem and select “New Simulation”. And then, select “NX Nastran Vibro-Acoustics, Type: Sim” and set file name and folder as shown in Figure 29.\n\n\nFigure 29\n\nSolution Setup\n\nWhen Solution window is open, click Edit on Vibro-Acoustic Output Request 1 as shown in Figure 30.\n\n\nFigure 30\n\nAnd then, set the parameters as shown below and Figure 31.\n\nSorting: SORT2\nEntity: Group\nNode Selection: MIC points\n\nFrom the Bulk Data in the Solution menu, click Fluid-Structure Interface Modeling Parameters, Create Modeling Object as shown in Figure 32. This enables coupling between acoustic medium and muffler structure. And then, set the Type of Coupling as Two-Way Coupling as shown in Figure 33.\n\n\nFigure 33\n\nSet output request and forcing frequencies as shown in Figure 34. Out frequency range of interest is 2- 2000 Hz with 2 Hz frequency step.\n\n\nFigure 34\n\nBoundary Condition\n\nFigure 35\n\nWe have two boundary conditions to be applied at the inlet and outlet of the muffler. First, we need to apply anechoic termination at the outlet, which means there is no reflection. Such a boundary condition can be applied in NX Nastran by using Automatically Matched Layer. Click Loads and Conditions, Simulation Objective Type, Automatically Matched Layer as shown in Figure 35.\n\n\nFigure 36\n\nClick “Create Region” in the Automatically Matched Layer Property window as shown in Figure 36.\n\n\nAnd then, click “Select Object” and click the outlet of the muffler as shown in Figure 37.\n\n\nFigure 37\n\nFigure 38\n\nNow, we will apply acoustic pressure at the inlet of the muffler. Click Loads and Conditions, Load Type, Enforced Acoustic Pressure as shown in Figure 38.\n\n\nAnd then, click “Select Object” and click the outlet of the muffler and set the magnitude as 1 as shown in Figure 39.\n\n\nFigure 39\n\nFigure 40\n\nIn addition, the inlet and outlet edges of the muffler will be fixed. Click Loads and Conditions, Constraint Type, Fixed Constraint as shown in Figure 40.\n\n\nAnd then, click “Select Object” and click the edges of inlet and outlet of the muffler and as shown in Figure 41.\n\n\nFigure 41\n\nSolve FEM Model\n\nClick “Solve” to start calculation as shown in Figure 42. In addition, we can set the number of cores for parallel processing from “Edit Solver Parameters.”\n\n\nFigure 42\n\nPostprocessing\n\nFigure 43\n\nOnce solution is complete, we have to do postprocessing to calculate transmission loss of the muffler. NX Nastran provide an option to calculate transmission loss by using “Post-Processing Scenario.” Click Solution 1, Results, Vibro Acoustic, Post-Processing Scenario as shown in Figure 43.\n\n\nFigure 44\n\nWhen the Scenario Setup menu is open, click Scenarios, Acoustics, Transmission Loss, and then click “Create Scenario” as shown in Figure 44.\n\n\nFigure 45\n\nNow, we have to select microphones at the inlet and outlet. Select “Inlet Nodes” as 1 and 2, “Outlet Node” as 3, and Surface Area Ratio Inlet/Outlet as 1 as shown in Figure 45.\n\n\nNow we can see the transmission of the muffler as shown in Figure 46.\n\n\nFigure 46"

This tool provides quick feedback on support structures as well as calculates parameters such as support volume, support contact area, build height, and down-facing areas (areas that do not need support structures). Because this module is developed to visualize the support structures for a particular orientation, the support structures are represented as lines for faster calculations.\n\nModelling of Solid, Hollow and Honeycomb Supports\n\nSupport Generation module is used to generate support structures needed to build the part for user-input build orientation. Different types of support structures can be generated using this module, details of which will be explained in the instruction manual.\n\nCalculation of Cusp Error\n\nCusp Error is a measure used to quantify the deviation between the designed and manufactured part. The cusp error has an effect on the surface finish of the manufactured part. This tool calculates the cusp error with respect to every facet of the CAD body and the average cusp error for the entire part build. All the facets satisfying the specified threshold cusp height are highlighted in green and the rest are highlighted in red. The user can specify different input parameters such as orientation of the part, layer thickness and threshold cusp height and perform analysis to determine the suitable build parameters for acceptable surface finish.\n\nCalculation of Build Time\n\nBuild Time is the total sum of the times taken by the laser to sinter each layer and the change over time between successive layers. This tool slices the body into several layers based on the specified layer thickness. The laser path in each layer is traced and the total sintering area and the sintering time across all the layers is computed based on laser velocity. The user can specify different build direction, slice thickness, laser parameters (diameter, speed, overlap) and hatch pattern to perform analysis and identify the build parameters which result in minimum build time for a given part."

Sometimes, we cannot offer academically strong students admission to their top choice CEAS majors; when this happens, we offer them spots in FEP to ensure that they have the support and resources necessary to graduate from CEAS.\n\nBenefits of the First-Year Engineering Program (FEP)\nGuaranteed Admission\n\nFEP students are guaranteed admission to all CEAS programs if they meet the FEP Criteria. \n\nAdvising and Mentorship\n\nThe First-Year Engineering Program Academic Advisors advise fewer than 200 students each year compared to a 400:1 college-wide ratio. This means that the FEP Academic Advisors can provide a high-level of individualized support, proactive advising, and success skill development during students’ first years. In addition, every FEP student is assigned to a faculty Career Mentor who serves as an additional guide during their first year at UC. \n\nCollege Inclusion\n\nThe First-Year Engineering Program is housed in the Department of Engineering and Computing Education in CEAS; this means that FEP students are already in the College of Engineering and Applied Science. FEP students are included in all college communications, events, and activities. \n\nChoosing a CEAS Major\n\nAll students, whether you're set on your engineering or engineering technology discipline of choice or still exploring, will be well-supported on their journeys to find their best-fit majors at UC. Events like Engineer Your Major and resources such as My Majors are integrated into the FEP student experience to help students get the most out of their time in the program.\n\nTransitioning to a Major from FEP\n\nFEP students have up to three academic semesters to meet the FEP Criteria for their applied program(s). \n\nContact Us\n\nCheck out the First-Year Engineering Program YouTube playlist for more detailed information about the program. \n\nPlease direct any questions about the First-Year Engineering Program to CEASAdvis@uc.edu."

It differs from a master of science degree in that it is focused on direct industry application more than research.\n\n\nAbout the Degree\n\nThe MEng degree offers flexibility in selecting courses that help you meet your career goals. You will focus on a particular concentration like Additive Manufacturing, but you can take courses from multiple disciplines if that’s what you need for your career. You can also add courses related to leadership and project management.\n\nDegree Backgrounds\n\nIndividuals with backgrounds in aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, materials science and mechanical engineering will be well prepared for these programs. Individuals with technology degrees in electrical and mechanical engineering and degrees in physics, math and some other engineering disciplines will also have the backgrounds needed to be successful.\n\n\nTime of Completion\n\nThe MEng program can take as little as one year to complete. Part-time and online options are available for some areas. You will advance your knowledge in one of the next hot engineering areas.\n\n\nOpportunities\nTraditional On-Campus Programs\n\nAvailable in all engineering disciplines offered through the college.  Program typically completed in two academic semesters plus one additional semester to complete the capstone.\n\n\nOnline Programs\n\nServing working engineers who cannot participate in a traditional program. The On-line programs offer 2 courses each semester so that the degree can be completed in 5 semesters.\n\n\nDual Degree Programs\n\nWorking with international partners – Students earn two degrees, one from UC and one from the international partner.\n\n\nAero-Systems Operations\n\nA specialized program provided in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux.  The program features a practice oriented program that results in two degrees, one from each university.\n\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe MEng degree requires completion of a minimum of 30 credit hours including:\n\nCore courses – to develop professional skills (2 courses required)\nDiscipline required courses – to develop graduate level technical competencies (number of courses varies by program)\nCapstone experience – demonstrates application of skills and synthesis of knowledge.  Several options available for completing the capstone.\nHandbook and Requirements\nMEng Graduate Handbook\nContact Information\nEugene Rutz\n\nAssoc Dean, CEAS - Graduate Studies\n\n816 MANTEI\n\n513-556-1096\n\nrutzee@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nAcademic Director in CEAS with responsibility for the Master of Engineering Programs, the accelerated engineering (ACCEND) programs, eLearning initiatives and high school dual enrollment programs.  Research interests in teaching and learning, efficacy of technology for education, learning...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nJulie J Steimle\n\nSES Program Coordinator, PASS, CEAS - Graduate Studies\n\n801B MANTEI\n\n513-556-1582\n\nsteimlje@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

This new degree offers a series of classes which will complement the new program to be delivered by the School of IT and the new BA in Cyber Strategy and Policy proposed by the Department of Political Science. In addition, the EECS Department offers an undergraduate certificate and a NSA graduate certificate in Cyber Operations.\n\nSPIA presentation: The School of Public and International Affairs is home to the Center of Cyber Strategy and Policy, which is a highly influential research center focused on national and international cyber security strategies. The School offers a new BA in Cyber Strategy and Policy, which provides both technical skills and expertise in the political, economic, social, technology, and organizational challenges that cyber insecurity creates and how to address that insecurity through improved policy, strategy, and law. The School offers graduate MA/PhD degrees in Public Administration and Political Science in which students can work with leading international scholars in cyber security studies as their focus.\n\nSchool of IT presentation: The School of Information Technology (SoIT) is home to the National Security Agency/Department of Homeland Security Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense. The Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity degree was first started in 2014 as a specialization area. The program is offered both online and on campus for full time and part time students. Over 200 students already graduated from the program and occupies roles such as Cybersecurity Analyst, Information Security Analyst, Security Operations Center Team Leads, Digital Forensics and Incident Response Analyst, Cyber Threat Detection Analyst, Penetration Tester, Cyber Risk Consultant, Cyber Threat Hunter, Threat Intelligence Analyst, Senior Information Security Specialist, and Cyber Security Counter Measures among others. Graduates are employed in a wide variety of sectors with companies such as Veeva Systems, Equifax, RoundTower Technologies, Splunk, GE Aviation, CBTS, Marathon Petroleum, Deloitte, Black Lantern Security, US Bank, Veeva Systems, and the Cincinnati Insurance Companies among others.\n\nIn addition to undergraduate programs that focus on hands-on technical skills, problem solving skills, and communication skills, the SoIT offers Master’s and Doctoral programs with specializations in Cybersecurity. At the graduate level, research methodologies and evidence-based practices are introduced to expand the learner’s abilities, knowledge, and skills to address complex problems following scientific methodology. The new Data-Driven Cybersecurity graduate certificate is a four-course graduate program that provides immersive experience on principles of cybersecurity, enterprise security, applied machine learning, and data-driven cybersecurity. Students in the graduate program work on research and applied cybersecurity projects.\n\nFurthermore, the SoIT offers, in partnership with the Ohio Cyber Range Institute, professional development programs through innovative four-week workshop that leads to industry credentials such as Network+ and Security+ among others.\n\nIn this presentation, you will learn about:\n\n The information technology space as the study of solutions and needs that connect people, information, and the technology of the time.\nThe Cybersecurity programs available for undergraduate, graduate, and workforce development.\nSoIT centers and their research and applied projects, especially those in the Cybersecurity space.\n\nAfternoon: Invited Talk, Ryan Wofarth, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)/EZAD. “TBD“\n\n\nCombatting Psyber-Security Attacks: Seth Adjei and Ankur Chattopadhyay (Northern Kentucky University)\n\nExisting literature shows that cyber-psychological issues among online users are on the rise, with mental health being the new cybersecurity attack surface, and COVID related misinformation, disinformation, and “fake news” being the corresponding attack vector amidst the ongoing pandemic. The threat of an online user being a victim to this is so significant that the World Health Organization calls this a COVID 'infodemic'.\n\nPsychological experts have termed this as a form of COVID psyber-security attack (COVID-PSA). Recently, there has been a few research and development (R&D) initiatives to address this current threat landscape of the COVID 'infodemic'. However, this research area is still a new, emerging one with a lot of prospective scope of work. In this novel R&D project, we have attempted to address this COVID-PSA threat by implementing a data analytics driven knowledge recommender, which is meant to be an adviser for users regarding the credibility of online COVID information.\n\nWe have designed and developed a unique web extension as this knowledge recommender’s maiden proof-of-concept prototype. It can be plugged into a web browser as an add-on and can indicate whether the online information is real or fake on a COVID website that users visit. Our unique COVID infodemic adviser tool includes textual data classifiers, which are trained on COVID information related real and fake benchmark datasets and uses advanced natural language processing techniques to parse the online textual information from websites.\n\nOur tool is a timely technological intervention for providing users with valuable insights on trustworthiness of COVID websites, for safeguarding them against potential COVID-PSA, and for raising overall awareness of looming infodemic threats. This first of its kind tool, which we have built, can contribute to further innovation, and lead to future path breaking research directions plus intellectual property intended for societal benefits.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nObtain basic knowledge about the topic of psyber-security and its connection with COVID infodemic\nUnderstand how the COVID infodemic is related to a psyber-security attack that exploits human vulnerabilities\nAppreciate emerging solutions, like text mining techniques plus NLP-based implementations, to address the COVID infodemic and mitigate these psyber-security attacks\n\n \n\n \n\nCHEST Activities and outreach efforts: Marty Emmert (EECS Dept. at UC)\n\nProfessor Marty Emmert in the EECS Department is leading the NSF sponsored Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (IUCRC) for Hardware and Embedded Systems Security and Trust (CHEST). To date, CHEST is the largest active IUCRC with six academic members: University of Cincinnati (lead university); University of Virginia; University of Texas at Dallas; Northeastern University; University of Connecticut; and University of California, Davis. Part of the CHEST charter includes workforce development and developing security, assurance and trust methodologies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This highly integrated group of Carnegie Research 1 universities provides a strong, existing collaborative platform to further expand existing efforts to promote public understanding of privacy, confidentiality, ethics, safety, and especially security implications of AI. All of our CHEST academic partners have similar programs, teaching, and research faculty in Cybersecurity, AI, and Machine Learning. In addition, CHEST has 25 industrial and DoD sponsors that will leverage the education, training tools, and modules we develop through this effort.\n\nWith the addition of the new BS in Cybersecurity Engineering, the University of Cincinnati will become a beacon in the field of cybersecurity, a giant step for providing the much needed workforce not only to the State of Ohio, but across all states in the US, which will secure its position of leader in the field worldwide.\n\nLate-Afternoon: Recruitment and Partner Session – Roundtables\n\nConcluding remarks: M. Cahay, R. Harknett, and Hazem Said"

Take a look at these student testimonials.\n\nJacob Mathers, Chemical Engineering/ICP Japanese Class of 2011:\n\"ICP has had a profound impact on my career. When I interviewed with Kao, my Japanese language and cultural experience were a major topic of conversation and a significant selling point which gave me, as a rookie engineer, an edge up on the competition. As a global company headquartered in Japan, Kao places a strong emphasis on the ability to work and cooperate internationally. Since I already had the proven experience working abroad as part of the ICP, I believe the company saw me as someone who would fit well with their culture and be able to be a productive team member.\"\n\nMorgan Brink, Operations Management and International Business/ICP Japanese Class of 2016:\n\"Companies LOVE hearing [in job interviews] that students have done something new or different while in school.\"\n\nAlexander Giovannelli, Computer Engineering/ICP German Class of 2018:\n\"This experience is the most valuable out of all the programs I have participated in during my studies at the University of Cincinnati and has truly changed my life. It has shown me that I am capable of achieving more than I ever imagined and has furthered my desire to study in my field, even if it takes me to a foreign place.\"\n\nContact\nErin Bove\n\nAssociate Director, International Programs\n\n(513) 556-4535\n\nerin.bove@uc.edu"

In the US, 3.25 billion records recorded were stolen with 540 breaches.  With 540 breaches it adds up to an increase of 356% in the last month and 98% over the same period in 2017 [Bonhill Group].  What is the first step a hacker would take to steal records?  Reconnaissance and the Cyber Kills Chain.\n\nPenetration tools and reconnaissance are important skill sets to have.  Knowing the tools that are involved can enhance your ability to gain access to secure environments.  Most major cyber-attacks have started with careful and time-consuming recon.  Every major cyber-attack has had well thought out and executed plans including the latest Equifax and Facebook breaches. \n\nAs a part of this talk, Professor Jones will demonstrate some of the physical tools used to collect information including the Wi-Fi Pineapple and how to do reconnaissance on the 2.4 GHz frequency and the ease of creating a man in the middle attack to collect valuable information on a target over Wi-Fi.  He will also demonstrate the use of tools such as bad USB and Rubber Ducky and how data can be taken from a physical machine.  As a part of the talk, Mr. Jones will demonstrate ways to protect yourself and data centers against these recon attacks including newly developed electrically conductive and reflective metalized fabrics.  These fabrics are used in products to protect people and equipment from electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI) and static discharge.      \n\nBio: Kyle Jones, Chair & Associate Professor of Sinclair’s Computer Information Systems Department. He worked in the IT field for over 17 years before coming to education.  Mr. Jones holds a CompTIA Strata, A+, Network+, Security+ certification as well as an ITIL Foundations.  He holds an Associate Degree in Network Engineering from Southern State, a Bachelors of Business from Wilmington College, and a Master’s Degree in Information Assurance and Security from American Public University. He is a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Principal Investigator and serves as the coordinator and curriculum specialist for Sinclair’s CIS 2640 Network Security class. In addition, Mr. Jones has been featured as a public speaker on cyber security topics. Most recently, he participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the Dayton Business Journal on the present landscape of cyber security, and was featured on WDTN Dayton-Channel 2 in a vignette about “Good Cyber Hygiene.” His previous work experience ranges from working for small PC repair shops to Fortune 500 Datacenters."

All of these attacks start with a bad actor exploiting weak security or software/hardware bugs gaining control over a system. Discovering vulnerabilities in software before an attacker is vital when trying to protect personal information, secure corporate data, and guard our national security. With the limited number of trained reverse engineers and security experts, research in this field often focuses on ways to automate the vulnerability discovery process.\n\nIn this talk, Aaron McCanty will be exploring some of the techniques used by researchers to discover, exploit and patch security vulnerabilities. He will also demonstrate some of the cutting-edge research being done to help automate the Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Discovery process. He will demonstrate the use of software and hardware fuzzers to rapidly find vulnerabilities, as well as how to utilize emulation in order to audit logic isolated from the reach of traditional fuzzers. He will also demonstrate how Hyper-Relational databases and custom language ontologies can be used to automatically find vulnerabilities in complex binaries.\n\nBio: Aaron McCanty is currently working as a Cyber Computer Scientist at Battelle Memorial Institute. His work is focused on Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Research, specifically targeting embedded systems and firmware. He also works extensively in developing machine learning algorithms to detect and thwart cyber-attacks. Mr. McCanty holds a Bachelors of Science in Computer and Information Systems with minors in Astrophysics and Economics from The Ohio State University.  "

Information security is currently one of the most popular topics in today’s news. Most of our communication happens through the internet—all of us use the internet as a tool for social interaction, e-commerce, and exchanging personal information, including electronic health records. Safeguarding our information has become tremendously important for every user, and improving education about cybersecurity in all fields is vital.\n\nOne of the fundamental aspects for secure communication for all of these transactions is that of using cryptography, a technique for encrypting or securing data so that only authorized users can access the data. Although cryptography by itself is not the complete solution, anyone involved in computer technologies needs to understand the key role played by cryptography for secure communication. In this presentation, Deep will cover the basics of cryptography, why it is important in secure communication, the types of cryptographic algorithms (i.e., hash, symmetric, and asymmetric), and how easy it is to decipher simple cryptographic algorithms.\n\nBIO - Deep Ramanayake is an associate professor at Gateway Community and Technical College. He received his B.Sc. from NKU in Mathematics and Computer Science, and his M.Sc. from Morehead State University in Information Systems. He has 20 years of experience in Information Technology related fields. He currently teaches a wide variety of IT courses including Information Security, Ethical Hacking, and Computer Forensics. His research is currently focused on education in cybersecurity, engaging students with real-world hands-on experience, practice, and exposure to working in teams in competition environments. He also trains the local community and works with local industries on cybersecurity awareness training.\n\n "

With the rapid growth of IoT devices that usually operate on low power consumption mode with constrained resources and produce an enormous amount of sensitive data, the software-based cryptographic approach currently is often inadequate or even not applicable to meet a variety of requirements for secure IoT data processing. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work that exploits the advance of hardware-based trusted execution technology to build secure, performant and unified IoT data processing framework. The proposed framework enables a broad range of IoT application services. Specifically, we will target one of the fundamental data services, search function, to demonstrate its satisfactory performance with our implementation. In addition, we also consider the challenging service revocation problem and present solutions in a hostile environment where system resources are controlled by malicious adversaries. I will also discuss the insufficiency by using conventional “divide-and-conquer” strategy to compartmentalize/eliminate the individual threat and show the urgent need for innovative solutions with emerging technologies.   \n\nBio: Dr Wenhai Sun is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Technology and the Faculty member of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) of Purdue University.

Such text content is valuable for detecting various types of cybercrime and understanding how they happen, the perpetrator's strategies, capabilities, and infrastructures and even the ecosystem of the underground business. Automatic discovery and analysis of such text traces, however, are challenging, due to their deceptive content that can easily blend into legitimate communication, and the criminal's extensive use of secret languages to hide their communication, even on public platforms (such as social media and forums). \n\nIn this talk, several studies, aiming at systematically studying how to automatically discover such text traces and intelligently utilizing them to fight against online crime, will be presented. I will describe a model to automatically discovery and understanding of dark jargon used in cybercriminal communications. I will also demonstrate that systematically analyzing the semantic inconsistency in the communication between criminals and their targets helps automatic detection of new variations of known crimes or abuses of new Internet services. The research outcomes contribute to more effective and timely control of online criminal activities.\n\nBio: Xiaojing Liao is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington. Her research interests include data-driven security, with a specific focus on the investigation of cybercrime and cyber threat intelligence. She has published papers on leading system security venues such as S&P(Oakland), Usenix Security, CCS and NDSS, and her works were widely covered by the mainstream media including the New York Times, CNN, Fox News, etc. "

Wang, et. al., IEEE MEMS 2021 Conference).  Robust metal molds for the devices are made using the micro electro-discharge machining (µEDM), which is a computer-controlled, effective micromachining technique for patterning any conductive materials with micron-scale feature sizes.  This tool is available in house at the MEMS and Autonomous Integrated Microsystem (AIM) Laboratory.\n\nIn this project, a microfluidic device for neuron culturing and neural circutry modleing will be designed, fabricated and tested.  This summer project allows the Protege students to work with graduate students and be exposed to interdisciplinary research in the field of MEMS and microfluidics, collaborating with Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and contributing to research tasks including literature review, design, hands-on microfabrication using the cleanroom facility, and testing in vitro of the fabricated devices.  Multiple students can be accommodated.\n\nFig. 1: Concept of neuron culturing and recording device with assembled microfluidic component.\n\nFig. 2: Photos of: (a) 15 microchannels (200×10×30 µm3, L×W×H) on sidewall of molded plastic separator.

The effect can be reversed: the presence of physical deformation (strain) in the material can cause a change in the magnetic property of the material, which can be wirelessly detected.\n\nFig: (b) Use of wireless ME sensors for biomarker detection.\n\nMagnetoelastic (ME) materials have been universally used as anti-theft security tags in shops.  These materials exhibit the magnetostriction behavior in which the magnetic property of the material changes under mechanical deformation (strain).  The application of such materials as sensors, particularly implantable microsensors for putting into the human body for biomedical applications, is of high interest due to its inherent passive wireless nature, which eliminates the needs for battery or antenna, leading to implanted devices with reduced complexity, size and cost.  The micro electro-discharge machining (µEDM) is a computer-controlled, effective micromachining technique for patterning ME materials for sensor fabrication with the micron-scale feature sizes.  This tool is available in house at the MEMS and Autonomous Integrated Microsystem (AIM) Laboratory. This summer project will allow the Protege students to work on the development of a ME sensor for biomarker detection with graduate students and be exposed to interdisciplinary research in the field of MEMS and microsystems, collaborating with UC School of Medicine and contributing to research tasks including literature review, design and simulation, hands-on microfabrication using the cleanroom facility, and testing in vitro and in vivo of the fabricated implantable microsensors.  Multiple students can be accommodated.\n\nDirector\nTao Li\n\nAssociate Professor, CEAS - Electrical and Computer Engineeri\n\n835 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-3508\n\nlitao@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nWebsite: https://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/AIM/\n \nDr. Tao Li is an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE PERSONAL WEBSITE"

In the third trimester, the same time that fetal elastin is produced, the myometrial layer of the uterus increases in elastin content by at least 5-fold. Postpartum, much of the elastin is degraded with the overall content returning to pre-pregnancy levels. During the third trimester there is a significant increase in estrogen and progesterone levels as well as significant mechanical stretch due to fetal growth and movement. The long-term goals of this project are to identify mechanisms by which we can induce elastin synthesis from many adult cell types for tissue-engineering and wound healing applications. To achieve this we must first identify potential mechanisms behind elastin synthesis in the known elastin producing cells. These mechanisms can then be validated to determine their effect on elastin or production of other extracellular matrix proteins.\n\nFigure 1: A) Basic structure of elastin.

Deep Learning algorithms are often used to detect the onset, progression and presence of disease using these images. While these algorithms are often successful in terms on prediction accuracy on well-curated datasets, the application of ML models/methods come with its own set of challenges. Firstly, we would like the model to capture biologically relevant insights that increases our understanding of these diseases. Secondly, these models need to generalize in the sense that the performance on one dataset should be observed in other datasets with different data acquisition protocols. Thirdly, these models need to be robust to noise that is inherent to biomedical images. \n\nIn this project, we will work on these issues in the context of functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRIs) of the brain. We will use a resting-state fMRI dataset of ADHD and controls. We will predict ADHD / control based on connectivity data. Then, we will evaluate the performance on a related population with ADHD comorbidity. This allows us to assess whether our method identifies patterns related to ADHD symptomology, and how this information transfers between clinical populations. \n\nProject 2: Uncovering Individual-level Uniqueness in EEGs\n\nEach one of us is unique. Our brains work differently due to both nature and nurture. In other words, differences in genetic makeup, as well our lived experiences makes dynamic brain activity different for each of us. These individual-level signals are called “brain signatures”. Brain signatures are important in the field of precision psychiatry as drug interventions are modeled differently for each patient.\n\nPreviously, our research group has used functional MRIs to show that a small group of regions on the brain cortex can be used to explain these individual-specific signals. However, we are now curious to see if we could get similar results with Electroencephalography (EEGs). EEGs have higher temporal resolution, but poorer spatial resolution. Hence, we will have to modify previous approaches to leverage the strengths of EEGs. \n\nIn this project, our goal is to characterize the frequency at which brain signatures can be detected in EEGs. This has applications to 1) devise new AR/VR devices that can incorporate brain signals from EEGs, and 2) guide preprocessing steps in medical and diagnostic uses of EEGs.\n\nHigh confidence edges that encode resting-state signature in fMRIs. The connectivity map shows that the signature is strongly expressed in the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex.\n\nDirector\nVikram Ravindra\n\nAsst Professor, CEAS - Computer Science\n\nRhodes Hall\n\n513-556-2988\n\nravindvm@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nI am an assistant professor at UC with expertise in many areas of data science, including ML, deep learning, multi-modal learning, and network science. I've recently obtained a PhD in computer science from Purdue University In my thesis, I developed and applied tools from ML/data...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

However, the machining of the material is a challenge as the high strength causing loss of tool wear, and the reinforcing epoxy would be challenging to the machine with thermal machining methods. In the UC Micro and Nano Manufacturing Laboratory electrical machining methods are provided to machining carbon fibers composites. Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) illustrated here is a unique machining process that utilizes an electric current to machine conductive and non-conductive material by this method. In this project, the student will use an existing pulse ECDM setup shown below to investigate the machining of different fiber composite materials (e.g., carbon fiber, fiberglass).  \n\nLearning opportunities for students\n\nAs this research is multidisciplinary in nature, it offers a tremendous opportunity for undergraduate students to be exposed to interdisciplinary research. The project will also introduce students to the various of academic research starting from literature review to report preparation. The experimentation involved will offer hands-on experience in research for the students. Students will learn about the theory behind the ECDM process and understand the working of the pulse ECDM. The students will also be encouraged to present the work at either a conference and/or prepare a paper for journal publication.\n\nScaling up of Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing\n\nElectrochemical additive manufacturing (ECAM) is a novel, emerging method of additive manufacturing that uses localized electrochemical deposition (localized metal plating) between a tool and a substrate when they are sufficiently close together in a metal plating bath. A current spike through the electrochemical circuit occurs when the tool and deposit touch, indicating that the metal deposit has grown between the tool-substrate gap enough to touch the tool. When this feedback is combined with a positioning and control system, this becomes an additive manufacturing (3d printing) process capable of depositing 3d metal parts. View the video.\n\nConcept of ECAM executed in a multi-electrode fashion\n\nThe goal of this project is for the student to extend the existing one-electrode system into a multi-electrode system capable of depositing complex, overhanging shapes. The concept is illustrated in Figure 2. The work of the project will involve the design and construction of the physical electrode array, as well as programming and testing of its operation.\n\nAn example concept of preliminary shapes built in one direction (vertical or Z) using a 3 x 2 array is shown in Figure 3. However, after a successful build of basic shapes, the students are encouraged to stretch to the limits of their imagination - what shapes can be built using different-sized arrays, arrays with different electrode orientations, and incorporation of the X and Y build directions?\n\nLearning opportunities for students\n\nParticipating in this project will expose the undergraduate student to hands-on, interdisciplinary research. Students will build have the opportunity to build rare and valuable skills in studying physical phenomena from first-principles, experimentation characterization methods, analog hardware design, and/or modeling of the process at the atomic scale. \n\nDemonstration of electrode activation for sample shapes built using a 3 x 2 electrode array\n\nFundamental research skills will be covered including literature review, presentation, and report writing. The undergraduate student will also be encouraged to begin building a professional body of research work by presenting the work at either a conference and/or preparing a paper for journal publication.\n\nFinal deliverables will include\nExperimental proof-of-concept on student-determined CAD files, beginning with simple shapes and progressing to the most complex shapes that the students can figure out how to build\nDescription on how the each array is constructed and its associated build algorithm works\nDocumentation on the problem-solving process to generate each array and algorithm\nStudents will gain exposure to\nProviding new knowledge on an emerging manufacturing technique\nConducting a literature review\nHands-on experiments with an electrochemical setup and hardware\nCoding  algorithms\nProblem solving\nAn excellent opportunity to exercise your initiative, creativity, critical thinking, scientific judgment, scientific knowledge, problem solving, and teamwork skills\nSimulation and experimentation of deep-hole machining process\n\nElectrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) is unique for the complex machining method that can machining non-conducive material such as glass with an electric current. The machining ongoing inside a hole is hard to characterize and therefore, simulation models are created for deep-hole analysis.\n\nIn this project, the student will use ANSYS fluent which is a common software for fluid-flow analysis to simulate the ECDM conditions in a deep machined hole. Then the student will use the optimize parameter they achieve in the simulation to create the deepest hole in glass with ECDM in our lab.\n\nLearning opportunities for students\n\nAs this research is multidisciplinary in nature, it offers a tremendous opportunity for undergraduate students to be exposed to interdisciplinary research. The project will also introduce students to various academic research starting from literature review to report preparation.\n\nStudent will learn to use ANSYS to create their own simulation model. The experimentation involved will offer hands-on experience in research for the students. Students will learn about the theory behind the ECDM process and understand deep hole ECDM. The students will also be encouraged to present the work at either a conference and/or prepare a paper for journal publication.\n\n\nWire EDM\n\nWhen you hear the word “machining”, usually you imagine conventional machining methods in a machine shop that use cutting tools: lathes, drills, mills, and so on. Electro discharge machining (EDM) is a nontraditional method of machining that uses the principle of spark erosion to remove material. EDM can take the form of die-sinking EDM (analogous to a drill press, as seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3), or wire EDM (analogous to a band-saw, as seen in Figure 4). This goal of this project is for the student to create a functioning wire EDM system.\n\nThe working mechanism behind EDM, whether it is operated in a die-sinking or wire method, is achieved by placing two electrodes, a tool and a substrate, in a dielectric fluid. When a high voltage is applied to the electrodes and they are sufficiently close, the dielectric breaks down and a spark occurs across the fluid, causing machining to occur, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\nThe laboratory has all the starting materials needed for a working EDM system:\n\nTool, substrate, and dielectric materials\nThree linear stepper motor stages for a 3-axis stage\nPower supplies\nInput/output boards of several brands to allow for computer sensing and control of hardware (Arduino, National Instruments, Raspberry Pi)\nElectronic circuit components such as wires, transistors, capacitors, alligator clips, resistors, and so on\nTroubleshooting tools including a multimeter, oscilloscope, and current probe\n\nThe task of the student is to automate a working wire EDM system from the materials available in the laboratory. The wire EDM configuration is shown in Figure 4, where the “tool” is a wire moving through a set of spools and able to cut the entire cross-section of the substrate.\n\nLearning opportunities for students\n\nParticipating in this project will expose the undergraduate student to hands-on, interdisciplinary research. Students will build have the opportunity to build rare and valuable skills in studying physical phenomena from first-principles, experimentation characterization methods, analog hardware design, and/or modeling of the process at the atomic scale.

Some recent work suggests that natural, processed, vocal fold projects injected into injured vocal folds can improve wound healing. We hypothesize that a portable nebulizer can serve as a convenient and affordable method to deliver a tissue specific extracellular matrix product to treat injuries to the voice box and trachea and improve over the need to leverage injections that require surgery. The proposed approach is designed to maximize ease of use, as it mimics current inhalers used for delivering other drugs. Our overall approach is to derive a formulation of extracellular matrix products from vocal folds that can be nebulized using commercially available nebulizers while retaining its anti-fibrotic and pro-healing properties. The first part of the project will focus on the optimization of the biomaterial formulation and nebulization parameters for targeted delivery. This will involve optimizing the particle size of the biomaterial and its formulation so that it can be delivered to a specific section of the upper airway of the rat model during the later phase of the studies. To ensure targeted delivery to the region of interest, we will compare the efficiency of two nebulization techniques: air jet nebulization and ultrasonic mesh nebulization. The nebulized form of the vocal fold extracellular matrix will then be tested in a rat model for pro-healing and anti-fibrotic effects as well as overall safety.\n\nDiagrammatic representation of project.

Symptoms of AS include very limited speech, difficulty sleeping, and poor motor function. AS is caused by a mutation or deletion of the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome 15 and is typically diagnosed in the early childhood period using genetic testing. At present, there is no cure for AS. Treatment is focused on supportive therapies and pharmaceuticals to manage seizures and reduce behavior problems. The AS community is motivated to find a cure, and several major gene therapy trials are underway to reduce or potentially reverse symptoms.\n\nDespite increased investment in clinical trials, functional outcomes that impact the lives of people living with AS and their families remain widely variable. A major barrier to clinical trials is the lack of available outcome measures suitable for AS. Wearable devices that monitor physiological and behavioral output are promising solutions because they provide objective metrics of physiological function without requiring verbal or motoric input from the patient. However, typical wearable devices in form factors such as smartwatches and headbands are often not tolerable by AS patients. Using input from AS caregivers from extensive focus groups (N = 8) conducted by our research team, we have designed MyA, a biometric vest that will measure several key signals relevant to AS (heart rate, respiration, vocalizations, temperature, and sleep), while meeting the unique sensory and tactile needs of the AS population. For our preliminary developments, we sewed conductive fabric and conductive silicone into separate commercially available athletic vests composed of primarily nylon, polyester, or polyamide. Our preliminary measurements of the electrocardiogram demonstrate the ability to capture key biosignals using our textile prototype. We were able to measure heart rate from the electrocardiogram within 2.4 beats per minute of a commercially available reference chest strap heart rate monitor with high correlation between the two devices (r = 0.88, p < 0.05).\n\nFor the proposed project, the Protégé Scholar will work closely with a senior member of the lab to integrate additional sensors into the prototype. The sensors will include but are not limited to, audio, GPS, locomotion, skin temperature, ambient temperature, ambient humidity, and Bluetooth Low-Energy. The Protégé Scholar will work with the senior member of the lab to validate each sensor on the benchtop and develop code that can be integrated seamlessly into the biosensor prototype.\n\nFigure 1. MyA system block diagram depicting essential internal functions as well as connections to the textile.\n\nProject 2: Smart Helmets for Detecting and Preventing Concussions\n\nFigure 1: The first smart helmet used an array of rosette strain gages to measure the deformations of the helmet shell during impact and analytical models related those strains to the impact force. We are currently developing a second-generation system to determine the placements for the minimum number of sensors required to reconstruct impacts over the entire surface of the helmet.\n\nWe are all familiar with the sight of an athlete experiencing a severe blow to the head and being unable to stand or walking shakily back to the sideline. In those instances, it is clear that the athlete has experienced a “concussion.” Concussion, as defined by the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, is a syndrome of biomechanically induced alteration of brain function potentially affecting memory, orientation, and state of consciousness and is the most common type of mild traumatic brain injury. Despite early work suggesting that concussion symptoms were directly correlated with the magnitudes of singular impacts, a more complete analysis of the data has made it clear that an impact threshold does not exist. In fact, the deleterious consequences of repetitive head impacts or sub-concussive blows can accumulate over time, causing tissue level damage that both increases susceptibility to later head impacts, and generally increases the volume of damaged brain tissue.\n\nWhile numerous attempts have been made to design sensor systems to measure head impacts, including in-helmet systems, wearable accelerometers, and even mouthguards, they only quantify risk of injury and even so with varying accuracy. Additionally, these sensors do little to encourage better technique. Recent work demonstrating that improved technique decreases an athlete’s exposure to head impacts suggests that the best intervention is one that helps coaches better prepare their athletes for practices and games. The goal of this project is to develop a system that mitigates head injury by tracking the force of each hit and provides a video-based tool that will allow coaches to teach better technique.\n\nThe Protégé Scholar will work with a senior member of the Hoilett and Human Injury Research and Regenerative Technologies (HIRRT) labs to develop a miniaturized device that combines high impact accelerometers, GPS, and Bluetooth capabilities into a single, discreet wearable. The wearable will track the force delivered by repetitive head impacts, map the location of these forces in real-time on a practice field, and relay this information back to a bay station that can be monitored by coaches and athletic training staff.\n\nProject 3: NeoWarm: Kangaroo Mother Care with Integrated Thermal Management and Vital Signs Monitoring\n\nNeonatal hypothermia is one of the most common and dangerous complications of premature birth. In resource-rich settings, incubators are typically used to prevent hypothermia; however, incubators are scarce in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is a technique that effectively combats the lack of incubators in LMICs. In KMC, a caregiver holds the newborn to their bare chest, augmenting the newborn’s compromised thermoregulation system. While KMC is highly effective, it requires the participation of the caregiver at all times and poses challenges for vitals monitoring used to assess the newborn’s health during their early stages of life. As a response to this need, we have developed NeoWarm, a device that will augment KMC. NeoWarm is an insulated newborn carrier with integrated sensors for monitoring temperature, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and particularly, blood-oxygen (SpO2) to detect apnea, another common complication of premature birth. Additionally, when the caregiver needs a break to care for themselves, NeoWarm can function as a stand-alone unit, monitoring and maintaining the newborn’s temperature without the caregiver.\n\nThe Protégé Scholar will work with a senior member of the lab to integrate each sensor into a single device. The scholar will help develop a professional-grade printed circuit board as well as firmware that will simultaneously track each physiological signal of interest using a microcontroller and send the resulting data to a previously developed smartphone application using Bluetooth Low-Energy.\n\nDirector\nOrlando Sanguinette Hoilett\n\nAsst Professor, CEAS - Biomedical Eng\n\nMANTEI\n\n513-556-4171\n\nhoiletos@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nDr. Hoilett is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.

However, transistor gate lengths have already reached to around 2 nm (i.e. Angstrom Era) and it is increasingly difficult to scale down the size of transistors due to limitations imposed by the device physics2. On the other hand, computing and data storage needs have increased drastically. It is well-recognized that novel device technologies for logic computing and data storage is necessary to address the demands of future computing. Students working on this project will work on advanced logic and memory device technology with a blend of both hands-on research in CEAS Cleanroom and MIND lab, and modeling. Ideal candidate will be EE student with interest in pursuing career in Semiconductor fabrication industry such as Intel or research in this area.     \n\nProject 2: Neuromorphic Computing Architecture with Emerging Neuronal and Synaptic Memory Devices\n\nThis project will involve Device Technology Co-optimization (DTCO) and System Technology Co-optimization (STCO) approaches for low-power computing architectures to enable Edge AI3. Students will research on various neuromorphic computing architectures and how they compare to the cortical circuitries in brain and designing brain-inspired architectures for cognitive data analytics in edge applications, such as sensors and transceivers.

These tumors can escape the natural host immune surveillance and subvert the physiological role of multiple brain cell types including vascular endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and immune cells2,3. Standard therapy for GBM consists of surgical resection of the main tumoral mass followed by radiation and chemotherapy4. Except for a few exceptions, tumors initially respond to these treatments, however, no current regimen can overcome tumor recurrence after which the chances of patient survival drop drastically to 6 months. While the exact mechanisms underpinning drug resistance are still largely unclear, the current leading hypothesis is that a small percentage of cancer cells with self-renewal potential, also named glioblastoma stem cells (GSC)5, could survive and be selected during the therapy. Such a limited population of resistant GSCs may eventually spread undetected through the brain and regenerate the tumoral mass during recurrences. Targeting GSCs and their specific niches represents a promising strategy for curing GBM, however, the field lacks robust translational models able to capture the complex set of molecular and biomechanical cues that are thought to support GSCs and that are normally generated by the healthy cells of the brain.\n\nIn our lab, we have recently established an enabling 3D model of GBM designed to recapitulate peculiar aspects of the brain tumor microenvironment that are known to modulate cancer resistance in vivo and including tissue-specific components of the extracellular matrix as well as human brain cells. This project will consist in conducting a proof-of-concept study to assess drug resistance of patient-derived tumors against existing and novel therapies. We will test the hypothesis that our new in vitro system supports patient-derived GSCs’ survival and maintenance of self-renewal markers when cancer cells are exposed to therapeutics used in the clinic. The project will include training in the use of advanced bioprinting methods, cell culture, and microscopy imaging.\n\nRodents have been used for decades to obtain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer cell resistance, however, the results of animal studies do not always translate in humans as demonstrated by many failed clinical trials of the past decade (doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-2750). In vitro studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms of cancer resistance6; however, existing models do not recapitulate the native tumor microenvironment of GBM. \n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that the ability of GSCs of surviving and proliferating in vitro requires molecular and biomechanical cues that are normally generated by the healthy cells of the brain, including its peculiar extracellular matrix mostly consisting of hyaluronic acid and low levels of collagens. \n\nMore advanced models are urgently needed for maintaining the GSCs viable in vitro and for capturing the complex heterogeneous nature of this lethal tumor. \n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Payton, Materials Science and Technology (2015).\n\nHydrogen has enormous potential to reduce greenhouse emissions from heavy industry and manufacturing. The Department of Energy is investing billions of dollars to bring hydrogen innovations to market and create clean energy jobs in the United States. A major hurdle to taking advantage of hydrogen, however, is that it embrittles the pipes and storage vessels that are needed to contain it. Our adoption of sustainable hydrogen requires new hydrogen-tolerant alloys to be engineered for long-term service. To date, alloys for hydrogen environment resistance have always been designed by modifying stainless steels or aerospace-grade Ni-based superalloys. A new understanding of the role hydrogen plays in embrittlement of metals has emerged, and along with it comes the opportunity to design and test new alloys based on recent revelations. In this project, the student will contribute to the design and development of new alloys for hydrogen resistance.\n\nStudents will gain exposure to:\n\nMelting and processing of metals\nPrediction of solidification behavior and microstructure of alloys using commercial software packages\nOperation of an electron microscope\nMechanical testing of materials\nScientific methods for alloy development\nIndustrial-academic collaborations to solve significant challenges for sustainability\nConducting a literature review\nEric Payton\n\nAssociate Professor, CEAS - Materials Science & Engineering\n\n627 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-0260\n\npaytonej@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nDr. Payton’s laboratory addresses the sustainability of critical materials through fundamental research into alloy design, discovery, and processing, enabling design engineers to balance performance with responsible resource utilization. Employing state-of-the-art computational...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

The fear of loss of communication with the UAV always haunts the operator. Moreover, limited flight time also forms a drawback in UAV operations. However, technological advancement in the field of robotics especially UAVs shows immense promise to address these concerns. One solution to the above mentioned issues consists of attaching a tether to the UAV. The tether forms a means for secure data transmission, continuous charging of drone and also enables safer handling of drones/UAVs. There exist several challenges to implement tethered drone systems in real world. This project addresses the most significant of those challenges by allowing the drone to be maneuverable via manipulation of tether. Development of controller, tackling of wind disturbance, obstacle avoidance and maintaining tension in tether form few of the challenges. In this context, the controller is required to be designed in a manner that will allow the UAV to be controlled by merely moving the tether, to fly it like a kite. Obstacle avoidance forms another challenging aspect of this system because not only the drone but the tether should also not get entangled with the obstacle. This project will involve the students to gain better understanding of the control schemes to address the above issues and also will help him/her in getting hands on experience on building a tethered UAV. The proposed work has tremendous societal impact. It can find applications in military, for inter planetary space exploration, for raffic monitoring and many more applications. \n\nTethered drone prototype (in progress)\n\nDrone on a stick (flying it like a kite)\n\nDirector\nManish Kumar\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Mechanical Eng\n\n629 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-5311\n\nkumarmu@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nCooperative Distributed Systems Lab\nUAV MASTER Lab\nDr. Manish Kumar directs Cooperative Distributed Systems...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

These materials exhibit the magnetostriction behavior in which the magnetic property of the material changes under mechanical deformation (strain). The application of such materials as sensors, particularly implantable microsensors for putting into the human body for biomedical applications, is of high interest due to its inherent passive wireless nature, which eliminates the needs for battery or antenna, leading to implanted devices with reduced complexity, size and cost. The micro electro-discharge machining (µEDM) is a computer-controlled, effective micromachining technique for patterning ME materials for sensor fabrication with the micron-scale feature sizes. This tool is available in house at the MEMS and Autonomous Integrated Microsystem (AIM) Laboratory.\n\nThis summer project will allow the Protege students to work on the development of a ME sensor for biomarker detection with graduate students and be exposed to interdisciplinary research in the field of MEMS and microsystems, collaborating with UC College of Medicine and contributing to research tasks including literature review, design and simulation, hands-on microfabrication using the cleanroom facility, and testing in vitro of the fabricated implantable microsensors.

It has higher energy content and lower vapor pressure when compared with ethanol. Butanol can be produced by Clostridium fermentation from biomass feedstocks. The products composition and productivity of Clostridium fermentation are determined by nutrients, primary and secondary metabolites and environmental factors. Combination of metabolomes with transcriptomes will provide deeper understanding of viability and productivity of Clostridium fermentation. The objective of this study is to identify metabolites and other stress compounds associated with Clostridium viability and productivity. The working hypothesis is that microbial metabolites are regulated by life cycle changes and environmental factor during fermentation. The approach is to use QToF-LC/MS and 1H NMR (Fig.1) to analyze all the extracellular and intercellular metabolites of engineered and wild-type strains under various stress. \n\nFig. 1. QToF LC/MS and 1H NMR analyses of metabolites.\n\nIt is expected that metabolomics analysis will reveal an orderly progression of changes in intracellular metabolites over the time course, and also the changes in intracellular metabolites associated to fermentation variability and longevity. It is expected that the levels of amino acids, upper glycolytic intermediates, and pentose phosphate pathway compounds changed in acidogenesis and solventogenesis will be determined. The levels of butyryl-phosphate and acetyl-phosphate in acidogenesis and solventogenesis will be revealed. ATP, NADH, butyryl-CoA, diphosphates, nucleosides and bases will be determined. The protégé students will work on metabolites analysis with hand-on experiences in sample preparation, QToF LC/MS analysis, microbial fermentation and 1H and 2D NMR analysis. \n\nDirector\nMaobing Tu\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Environmental Eng & Science\n\n701D MANTEI\n\n513-556-2259\n\ntumg@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nOur research is centered on the development of cost-effective processes for producing biofuels, chemicals and biomaterials from lignocellulosic biomass.

With the new and improved features that the software vendor releases continuously, edge cases of a feature and interactions of multiple features are less tested. For example, Zoom released the “Declining a meeting invite with a message” feature in September 2022 (see image below). Has this feature been thoroughly tested? Does this feature interfere with any existing Zoom features? An answer to the latter question is the “Do not disturb” feature that allows the user to block any pop-up notifications for chat. These two features work well in isolation, but fail to meet the goals in composition. This Protégé research project is aimed at developing algorithms to automatically test newly released features and feature interactions, thereby improving software quality and user satisfaction. The algorithm development will involve several components: (1) performing natural language process (NLP) of feature descriptions, (2) building test scripts, and (3) automating the acceptance test execution.\n\n“Declining a meeting invite with a message” feature released by Zoom in September 2022 (image source: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/9515004675341-Declining-a-meeting-invite-with-a-message).

In particular, bone defects greater than 2cm in length are termed “critically-sized” since they often cannot heal spontaneously. These large  bone injuries are often treated with autologous bone grafts, or bone tissue harvested from the patient’s own body, though these procedures are limited by donor site morbidity and a limited amount of harvestable bone. To overcome these shortcomings seen with bone grafts, our lab is seeking to develop synthetic, “off-the-shelf” systems to regenerate these large bone injuries. We are currently developing an injectable drug delivery system made from coated microparticles that can release multiple therapies in sequence to promote the growth of new blood vessels and new bone tissue. The ~10µm particles, made from the polymer poly(propylene sulfide) (PPS), can be loaded with bone-regenerating drugs during fabrication but are small enough to be injected from a syringe. These particles can also be coated with a separate vessel-regenerating drug (Figure 1A). Importantly, both the drug coating and drug-loaded particles are selectively degraded by cell-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). This allows for sequential drug release from the injected microparticles after triggering by the local cells at the bone injury site (Figure 1B-D).\n\nFor this proposed project, the Protégé Scholar will be heavily involved in the development of these coated microparticles. The Protégé Scholar will assist in optimizing the particle coating process, measuring drug release kinetics, and evaluating the biological response of this system in preparation for future pre-clinical testing in more complex biological models\n\nOverview of the dual therapy system. a) Synthesis of drug loaded PPS microparticles coated with drug loaded LbL thin films. b) Injection of the system into a critically-sized bone defect. c) Initial ROS-degradation of thin film and pro-angiogenic drug release, followed by d) ROS-degradation of PPS microspheres and pro-osteogenic drug release.\n\nDirector\nJohn Robert Martin\n\nAssistant Professor, CEAS - Biomedical Eng\n\n134 UCBIOSCI\n\n513-556-6548\n\nmarti7j3@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nJohn R.

In severe peripheral nerve injuries, nerve pathways, connections, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) tissue surrounding nerve that lead to the sensory or motor targets are damaged. If the injury gap is larger than 2 centimeters, functional recovery is extremely limited and no adequate therapies are currently available. This deeply impacts the quality of life due to the loss of connection between the central nervous system and the body’s extremities. Neurons do not have the ability or needed signals from the damaged ECM surrounding the injury site to allow guided growth of axons across the injury space. Therefore, this project will address the urgent need to engineer novel biomaterials that give the proper electrical, physical, and chemical signaling to cells and neurons for guided nerve regeneration and provide functional recoveries in traumatic nerve injuries. This will be accomplished by engineering biomaterials (Figure 1A,B) to possess the proper physical, electrical, and chemical signals in order to direct cell alignment and growth. We will develop these biomaterials to deliver defined, tunable signals to the cells in order to elicit the desired cellular outcomes (Figure 1C,D). It is hypothesized that the biomaterial, in combination with relevant cells and ECM, will functionally bridge the injury gap to restore function to injured tissues.\n\nFigure 1: (A,B) Scanning electron microscopy image of electrospun PVDF polymer of defined chemical, physical, and electrical properties with Schwann cells growing on fibers.

The spinning platform can also leverage centrifuge-based sample preparation workflows to enable pre-PCR nucleic acid extraction. Integrating a smartphone-based fluorescence detection of post PCR analysis enables inexpensive and portable “sample-to-answer” molecular diagnostic platform.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThe recent global pandemic (COVID-19) has exposed some of the key limitations in our current infectious disease management systems, particularly when applied in remote underdeveloped areas. Existing approaches (like the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests) are highly resource-intensive, relying on people depositing their biological samples to collections centers where trained personnel process these samples in dedicated laboratories for further analysis. These inefficient channels introduce a considerable time lag between sample collection, diagnosis, and implementation of countermeasures. A need, therefore, exists for developing inexpensive and simple tools that can be broadly deployed to accelerate diagnosis, and provide real-time data to better inform decision making. \n\nProject Description\n\nThe Protégé student will work in Dr. Priye’s laboratory to develop inexpensive and simplified instruments/protocols that can replace traditional bulky, expensive and power intensive laboratory instruments required for infectious disease diagnostics. One of the major challenges associated with making PCR tests more accessible is the need for thermal cyclers which repeatedly heat and cool the biological samples using power consuming Peltier heating elements. We will explore unconventional and novel techniques of heating samples that are more efficient and inexpensive such as heat generation via eddy currents and lasers. Detection of PCR tests is accomplished using expensive fluorometers. We will explore simpler optical setups such as the use of smartphone cameras or raspberry pi cameras to read fluorescent signals from PCR tests.    \n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAlong with gaining research experience in the laboratory, the protégé student will learn and apply 3D printing, CNC machining, Arduino and python programming, Microfluidics technology and physics-based modeling. Students are encouraged to document their results and successful completion of the project can result in a journal publication.\n\nDirector\nAashish Priye\n\nAssistant Professor, CEAS - Chemical & Env Eng\n\n693 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-3261\n\npriyeah@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nOur research is primarily curiosity driven, where we take an engineering and physics based approach to explore biophysical processes occurring at the micro-scale.

The focus of the research will be characterizing the downstream boundary layer health in terms of the boundary layer thickness, displacement thickness, momentum thickness, and shape factor. The three-dimensionality of the boundary layer will be measured to characterize the spanwise effects on the boundary layer. The goal of this research is to study the fundamental physics of shallow wall jets and their impact on the boundary layer health to identify promising designs for decreasing the local momentum deficits in boundary layers.

A new facility is currently being designed and developed with planned fabrication in the summer of 2022. The facility will have full optical access in the test section to enable advanced optical diagnostics internal to the propulsion flowpath with the ability to control backpressure which simulates changing conditions during hypersonic flight.\n\nThis project will involve assisting with:\n\nDetailed manufacturing drawings of the 3D CAD wind tunnel design\nDevelopment of control systems for wind tunnel operation\nDevelopment of software for wind tunnel control and data acquisition\nProject 3: Aeroacoustics of Human Ears\n\nAeroacoustics is the study of noise generated from aerodynamic phenomena.

    "html": "College of Engineering and Applied Science » Academics » Departments » Engineering & Computing Education » Undergraduate Research » Gas Dynamics and Propulsion Laboratory\n\nSet Navigation title in component\nDepartments\nAerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics\nBiomedical Engineering\nChemical and Environmental Engineering\nCivil and Architectural Engineering and Construction Management\nComputer Science\nElectrical & Computer Engineering\nEngineering & Computing Education\nMajors & Programs\nUndergraduate Research\nArchives\nSuperconducting Nanoelectronics with Perovskite Oxides\nFaculty & Staff\nLearning Center\nMechanical and Materials Engineering\nMajors & Programs\nGraduate Advising\nUndergraduate Advising\nGas Dynamics and Propulsion Laboratory (7 Projects)\nDepartment of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics\n\nThe Gas Dynamics and Propulsion Laboratory (GDPL) is located on campus, at a satellite research park, and in the Medical Sciences Building, and affords the researcher exceptional experimental and computational facilities. The laboratory occupies a high bay area with over 10,000 square feet of floor space. The most advanced flow and propulsion diagnostics are available, in addition to state-of-the-art computational capabilities. A brief description of the research topics performed at GDPL follows.\n\n\n1. Jet Noise-Prediction and Reduction (Funded by GE Aviation, NASA, US Dept. of Defense, ONR, Sweden DoD, NRL)\nThe advent of jet engine as a power plant for military and civil aircraft and its unavoidable counterpart, jet engine noise, initiated substantial research on the sources and causes of jet noise, as well as methods and devices for its reduction. The noise level of jet engines, particularly during takeoff and climb, is often a concern for people living near airports or working near airplanes. Such high noise levels can limit future airport air traffic expansion, and force new airports to occupy remote sites. It also limits the ability of personnel to work for extended times near airplanes. New requirements for lower jet noise are a continued area of interest both by governmental agencies and by neighborhoods located in close proximity to airports, flight paths and to engine and flight vehicle manufacturers. Due to these concerns a need to further jet noise reduction technology is in demand.\n\nVarious approaches have been proposed to overcome the noise issue. The optimal solution should be such that substantial noise suppression is achieved using a method that is easy to implement, low cost, reliable, and without substantial adverse effects on the engine performance. Development of such devise requires basic understanding of the noise generation mechanisms. The objectives of our research are to evaluate experimentally new concepts for jet noise reduction and to develop analytical or numerical tools for the prediction of jet noise and jet noise reduction techniques for commercial and military engines (subsonic and supersonic jets).\n\n2. Combustion Control and Flameless Combustion (Funded by Office of Naval research, NASA, GE Aviation and UTC)\n\nConsiderable amount of work in the area of passive and active combustion control for gaseous and liquid fueled combustion has been reported during the last two decades. These studies have dealt mostly with bluff-body-stabilized combustor and dump combustors where the recirculation induced by a bluff-body or by a sudden expansion is used to stabilize the flame and were more recently extended to swirl stabilized combustors. Active control strategies have been used to suppress thermo-acoustic instabilities resulting from a coupling between the heat release and the acoustic modes in the combustor. These control strategies have generally relied on modulating the fuel injection and phase shifting it so as to decouple the pressure rise and heat release with respect to each other. Control strategies have also looked at improving fuel efficiency and reducing pollutants, and in extending flammability limits. Our research deals with the control of gas-turbine gaseous and liquid fuel combustors with swirlers, bluff body stabilizers and distributed fuel injection for rapid mixing and stabilization. It focuses on investigating the mixing patterns and flame structure in these combustors and developing control strategies for improved performance of gas-turbine combustors.\n\nIn addition, we are developing new technology of combustion, called “Flameless Combustion” for gas turbine engines. This technology provides low emissions and very stable combustion and has the potential of becoming the next generation of combustion systems for propulsion and power generation gas turbines.\n\n\n3. Rotating Detonation Engines - RDE (Funded by NASA, ONR, AFOSR, and GE Aviation/GEGR)\n\nA  pulse detonation engine (PDE) offers few moving parts, high efficiency, high thrust, low weight, low cost, and ease of scaling.  These make the PDE an attractive alternative to jet turbine engines for small disposable engines.  The near constant volume heat addition process, along with the lack of a compression cycle, lend to the high efficiency and specific impulse, simplicity, and low-cost of pulse detonation engines.  Pulse detonation engines have the potential for operation at speeds ranging from static to hypersonic, with competitive efficiencies, enabling supersonic operation beyond conventional gas turbine engine technology.  Currently, no single cycle engine exists which has such a broad range of operability.  Computational and experimental program is conducted at UC to investigate the performance of an air breathing pulse detonation engine (PDE).  This research effort involves investigating such critical issues as: detonation initiation and propagation; valving, timing and control; instrumentation and diagnostics; purging, heat transfer, and repetition rate; noise and multi-tube effects; detonation and deflagration to detonation transition modeling; and performance prediction and analysis.  Our lab has a unique hybrid engine that includes an array of 6 PDEs integrated with an axial turbine.  This system potentially can replace the entire high pressure core of a jet engine, including high pressure compressor and turbine and the combustor.\n\n\n4. Novel Augmentor System Design (Funded by GE Aviation, AFRL, ONR)\n\nA new and unique facility that simulates the flow conditions in an afterburner configuration is operating in our laboratory. The facility includes a combustor with an exhaust duct where innovative strategies of secondary fuel injection can be tested. It is also instrumented for advanced flow and combustion diagnostics. The facility is used to study secondary combustion dynamics in an augmentor configuration. The research emphasizes new concepts for flame stabilization, and investigation of combustion instabilities in augmentors and their prevention using passive control and acoustic liners. The research combines experimental and computational work.\n\n\n5. Flight Control of Modern Shaped Wings Using Vortex and Flapping Actuators (Air Force Research Laboratory)\n\nLift force on modern shaped wings at a high angle of attack relies on complex set of vortices that are formed at the leading edges, flaps, and tips of the wing.  At high angle of attack these vortices loose gradually their coherence due to intrinsic flow instabilities.  At these conditions, the lift produced by the vortices is reduced and the aerodynamic moments derivatives change from stable to unstable conditions causing loss of controllability and stall.  Tests showed that small continuous, pulsating, or flapping microjets that are injected into the separated regions from certain locations on the wing surface could control the behavior of the flow over the wing.  Depending on the orientation of the injected microjets, the flow pattern over the wing can be altered to achieve the desired controllability.  The microjets injection can therefore be used for flight control without the conventional control surfaces.  Controlled actuation of different combinations of microjets based on feedback from sensors distributed over the wing surface can yield the desired pitch, yaw, and roll moments. Moreover, this method incurs little or no drag penalty.\n\nThe control system relies on rational activation of pulsating jets. Static and dynamic modeling of the flow topology, aerodynamic responses and actuator characteristics are required for closed-loop control system design.  Advanced external flow control and aircraft attitude control architectures and algorithms are needed to cope with the highly coupled, time-varying, uncertain and complex nonlinear  aerodynamics that are dynamically and structurally unstable.\n\nThe present concept is applicable to attitude control of tailless fighters, reentry vehicles and UAVs, especially micro UAVs, without requiring control surfaces such as ailerons, rudder, elevator, or flaps.  This type of controlled lift can also be used to enhance performance of lifting bodies.  The advantage of such a system lies in its aerodynamic simplicity, reduced radar cross-section and ease of miniaturization.\n\n6. Airway, Voice, Cardiovascular Research (Funded by NIH, UC CoM, CCHMC, NCAI)\n\nMechanisms of voice production are not well understood.  They involve interaction between flow and structural vibrations of the vocal folds within the larynx; this is the aeroelastic aspect of the mechanism.  The interaction between the flow and vibrating folds modify the flow and produces highly vortical flow pattern.  This flow includes organizes vortices and random turbulence generates sound via mechanisms described by aeroacoustic theory.  The sound is amplified and filtered in the mouth cavity before exiting as voice.  Our jet noise research described in section 1 above has many similarities to voice generation mechanisms.  Our research investigates the relationship between the flow field and the noise produced by the jet and both experimental and computational tools are useful for the larynx applications.  The voice research is a collaborative effort between our laboratory and the Otolaryngology Department at the UC School of Medicine.  Our goal is to develop the physical understanding of voice production that will help in developing new medical treatment and surgical procedures for patients with voice pathologies.\n\nIn addition to voice research we are collaborating with the Pulmonary and ENT Departments of CCHMC (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital) in applying CFD to compute airway flow and pressure distribution for sleep apnea and airway reconstruction research.\n\n\n7. Advanced Scramjet Propulsion (Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA)\n\nScramjet combustors are characterized by an extremely short residence time for the completion of fuel atomization, mixing and combustion.  It is therefore desired to develop fuel injection schemes that will accelerate the mixing process by improving penetration, achieving small-dispersed fuel droplets, and enhancing mixing. In addition, during vehicle acceleration the location of heat release in the combustor has to shift to ensure optimal performance in the entire range of Mach numbers.  This project addresses the aforementioned issues by investigating fuel injection flow control strategies.  Specially designed injectors are designed and tested in quiescent, cold cross flow, and reacting conditions.  The effect of fuel temperature, as the fuel is heat soaked for combustor cooling, would also be simulated to test the stability of the injectors. Emissions, which are a critical concern for commercial space applications, would also be used as a performance parameter in evaluating the injectors. In parallel with these experiments, numerical modeling is pursued to study the flow physics and effectiveness of the different injector configurations in cold and reacting flows.\n\nDirector\nEphraim J.

The MS ACCEND track culminates in a research experience and thesis.\n\nMaster of Science (MS) Cosmetic Science\n\nThe ACCEND program that offers an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering along with the Master of Science in Costmetic Science at the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy. \n\nCostmetic Science Requirements\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Business Administration at the Lindner College of Business will appeal to students who want to understand both the technical side of an organization and the business aspects of the organization. Students seek this program because it increases their value to an organization and prepares them to take on a management role earlier in their careers. Tuition and fees for the MBA program through ACCEND are managed by the Lindner College of Business. Students should discuss costs with an LCB advisor.\n\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Engineering will appeal to students interested in greater breadth in engineering and want to focus on the practice of engineering.\n\nThese students often are seeking pragmatic skills and knowledge that will allow them to improve the contribution they make to a technical organization. The MEng provides a traditional coursework based master’s and does not include a thesis component.\n\nMaster of Education in Curriculum & Instruction (MEd)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Curriculum and Instruction will appeal to students who have an interest in teaching in high school, middle school, or possibly community college.\n\nThe program provides the rigorous technical education of the engineering degree along with the teaching skills and certifications needed to work in education.\n\nJuris Doctorate (J.D.)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with a Juris Doctorate (J.D.) in Law will appeal to students who want to enter the legal profession.  Engineer-attorneys can sit for the patent bar, and are also well-equipped to handle many other transactional or litigation matters that center upon technical issues.  (Students will not be able to complete JD at the same time as their bachelor’s degree.  However, they can complete 15-30 credits of the 90 credit hour degree prior to BS graduation.)\n\nAdding the MS, MEng, or MBA program\nApplying to the MS, MEng, or MBA program\n\nACCEND Students must have an open graduate program so graduate courses count toward that degree.  That requires ACCEND students apply to the Graduate School prior to taking any graduate level courses. Students should apply to the graduate program the semester before they are ready to take their first graduate course.  Instructions for applying to the Graduate program are provided below.  Both the undergraduate and the graduate programs will be open – students will register for graduate classes in the graduate career, and undergraduate classes in the undergraduate career.\n\nImportant Billing Information\nWhen a student registers for 6 or fewer graduate level semester hours, tuition and fees will be at the undergraduate level.\nWhen a student registers for 7 or more graduate level semester hours, tuition and fees will be at the graduate level.\n\nCourse planning is of critical importance. Students should take no more than 6 grad credits any semester prior to the 5th year\n\nExpand AllCollapse All\nSteps to Apply to the Graduate School \nFinancial Aid \nScholarships \nGraduation\nYou will need to apply to graduate from both programs and you will pay the graduation fee twice\nYou cannot graduate from your Graduate Program before you graduate with your undergraduate degree, but you can graduate from both programs in the same term, or your BS program one term, and your MS, MENG, or MBA a later term"

When manufacturing a part using AM, the designer has several different build orientations to choose from making the process of choosing the best or optimum build orientation difficult. And sometimes the best building orientation is not intuitive, as one building direction may reduce the cost of material consumptions but increase the total building time, while one may reduce the building time but compensate the geometry accuracy.\n\nThe Center for Global Design and Manufacturing (CGDM) at the University of Cincinnati (UC) have developed a set of pre-processing tools that can identify the best building orientation from the point of view of manufacturability based on the requirements of the designer, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. A custom designed GUI is provided for users to freely define the problem based on different manufacturability criteria based on the part geometry. \n\nFigure 1: Design parameters that are considered to calculate the producibility Index\n\nFigure 2: List of design parameters and their units for calculating producibility index\n\nThis tool can optimize the build orientation based on various Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) constraints. Such DFAM features includes small openings, thin features, sharp corners, thin to thick transitions, recoater arm collisions, thin walls, cusp errors. The tools also consider various support parameters including support volume, support contact area, down facing area not requiring support, support removal accessibility, build height and build time. Producibility index (PI) combines all the design parameters that are mentioned into one single knowledge base to increase the manufacturability of the designs. It’s the measure of goodness of a design’s manufacturability in a build orientation. For each orientation, it will calculate all the parameters listed here and gives one value.\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati have developed an algorithm to quantify each design features with variable units and orders of magnitude into same scale. Each feature has a weight input by the user, the weight indicates the importance of the features in the final PI score. The final PI score is calculated by evaluating each feature and combining with the user input weight. The highest PI value indicates the orientation with the best manufacturability considering all the design features as shown in Figure 3.  The orientation optimization algorithm will rotate the part through 360 degrees on the x and y axes in user-specified increment angles and find the best candidate orientations with highest PI scores.\n\nFigure 3: Custom GUI and result output in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nOrientation Optimization\n\nFirst step in orientation optimization is to setup analysis parameters. A custom GUI is provided  in NX to allow the designer customized the parameters for the analysis. The User can input candidate building orientations that need to be analyzed, threshold values for DFAM features, support structure parameters, machine parameters such as hatch pattern and layer thickness, and weight of each features.\n\nThen, Using the algorithm developed by UC implement in Siemens NX with NXOpen. The tool starts to analyze each feature and returns quantified raw values for each orientation until all the candidate orientations have been analyzed. Then PI score of each candidate orientation is shown as well as recommend best ordinations.\n\nUser’s weights input plays an important role in determine the best building orientations. Depending on manufacturing requirement, the user can input different weight factors to each individual feature. As result, the best building orientation will change accordingly that could achieve optimized manufacturability.\n\nFor example, if the goal is to find the best orientation for orientation for least amount of support structure parameters and build height. Then designer may choose to give very high weight to the support volume parameter, support contact area parameter, build height and build time parameter, support accessibility parameter. However, if the designer cares more about geometry accuracy and least distortion in the part, then the higher weight value should be given to features such as small openings, thin features, thin to thick translons, sharp corners, thin walls, recoater arm collisions etc. Figures 4 and 5 show different best building orientations with different weights input.\n\nFigure 4: Part best orientation for minimizing support parameters\n\nFigure 5: Part best orientation for minimizing geometry error and distortion"

In an ever-competitive environment, aligning education with employer’s needs is the priority of classroom work. Students not only need to know how to create virtual model in CAD software, but also need to know how the geometry is created through several inputs. Because employers want creative employees rather than button pushing robots; at the same time, employees want strong fundamental knowledge to reinforce their competitiveness rather than superficial stuff.\n\nRecent development in computer technology, especially CPU, GPU, RAM, have pushed the CAD modeling into more and more fancy style in the past two decades. But, the fundamental knowledges of geometric modeling never change, they are the rock which the fancy CAD GUI built on, such as the transformation of geometry and construction of curve and surface with points and vectors.\n\nIn recent days, most classes on geometric modeling focus on teaching students how to use one specific CAD software, which will eventually drive students into button pushing robots. On the other side, teaching students with both theoretical knowledges about geometric modelling and hands-on skills of CAD software, offer students with much wider scope view about the geometric modeling process which will eventually increase students’ competitiveness.\n\nGeometric modeling\n\nDepartment of Mechanical and Material Engineering in University of Cincinnati offers two classes in geometric modeling: Engineering Design Graphics which focus hands on skills on GUI drawing with NX, CAD for Manufacturing which partially focus on the theoretical knowledges about the construction of geometry in computer. Professor Sam Anand is the lecturer of CAD for Manufacturing. To improve students’ understanding process, the digital twins of the theoretical methods taught in classroom were created. These digital twins include several NX based geometric modeling applications which were created in his group, includes Object Rotation module, Object Reflection module, Object Scaling module, Hermite Curve Design module, Hermite Surface Design module, Bezier Curve Design module and Bezier Surface Design module. With the help of these digital twins, students can get a straight forward view about the influence of each parameters to the final result, such as the shape and normal vectors of surfaces. Furthermore, students can use these digital twins to validate their hand calculation of their homework assignments. Ultimately, these digital twins improve students’ competitiveness in future’s job-hunting.\n\nObject Rotation module\n\nThe objective of this module is to create digital twin of the rotation method and demonstrate the rotation of any given body about specified arbitrary axis with all the intermediate steps leading to final transformation. The outcome of this module is that students can visually correlate 3D geometry transformations as shown in Figure 1 with underlying mathematical formulation and reinforce their understanding. \n\nFigure 1: Rotation GUI and result\n\nObject Reflection module\n\nThe objective of this module is to create digital twin of the reflection method and demonstrate reflection of a geometry object about a plane specified by a point and normal, as Figure 2. The outcome of this module is to let students visually see the reflection process and the coordinates of the vertex at current location verse its original location. With the help of this digital twin, students can validate their hand calculation process and help them on both theoretical understanding and line algebra. \n\nFigure 2: Reflection GUI and result\n\nObject Scaling module\n\nThe objective of this module is to create digital twin of the geometric scaling methods (both uniform and non-uniform) and demonstrate the shape and size change of the part, as Figure 3. The outcome of this module is helping students to understand scaling of various complex part and validate their assignments results through the digital twin.\n\nFigure 3: Scaling GUI and result\n\nCubic Hermite Curve module\n\nThe object of this module is to create the digital twin of Hermite curve method and plot Hermite curves by varying user inputs and calculate tangent vector at any parametric value on the Hermite curve., as Figure 4. The outcome of this digital twin module is to help students learning the impact of changes in parameters (start point, end point, tangent vectors) on the shape of curve. Students can visually see the shape of the curve and get tangent vector of any point on the curve. This digital twin offers them an easy way to check their knowledge understanding and hand calculation.\n\nFigure 4: Hermite curve GUI and result\n\nBicubic Hermite Surface module\n\nThe objective of this module is to create the digital twin of the theoretical method of generate bicubic Hermite surface with normal vectors, tangent vectors and modify surface based on user inputs, as Figure 5. The outcome of this module is to increase the students’ understanding of the behavior of bicubic Hermite surface respect to the change of surface parameters (control points, tangent vectors, twist vectors). The module can output and display the coordinate of any point on the surface and its unit normal vector based on the U-W value, this can help students to crosscheck whether their calculation is right or wrong and get stright forward idea about how the surface looks like.\n\nFigure 5: Hermite surface GUI and result\n\nBezier Curve module\n\nThe objective of this module is to create digital twin of the theoretical method of Bezier curve construction and plot Bezier curves along with its control points, control polygon, tangent vector at a specific location and convex hull, as Figure 6. The outcome of this module is to help student to study the properties of a Bezier curve and the impact of parameters on the shape of the curve. With the visualization of all the parameters through this digital twin, students can get a very straight forward understanding of the methods.\n\nFigure 6: Bezier curve GUI and result\n\nBi-cubic Bezier Surface module\n\nThe objective of this module is to create the digital twin of the method to construct a Bi-cubic Bezier surface with given control points and plot it, as Figure 7. The outcome of this module is to help students to understand how the control points influence the shape of the surface. As shown in figure, the module can display the coordinate and normal vector of any point on the surface, this is helpful for students to validate their assignment results because this digital twin can offer a straight forward visualization of the surface and its normal vector of any give location.\n\nFigure 7: Bezier surface GUI and result\n\nConclusion\n\nNX API is a powerful tool for visualization of any geometric shape. Because these geometric modelling are so basic that most people neglect them and eventually become button pushed robots. With help of NX API and powerful NX visualization capability, the digital twins of the methods for geometric modeling were created, and can be executed step by step. Through this process, students get more steady and robust understanding of the theoretical fundamental knowledges, in conjunction with the hands-on skill from Engineering Design Graphics class, it yields competitive advantages for students on the future product design and job-hunting."

DMLS technology uses a high-power laser to melt metal powders locally and fuse it into solid parts. Parts are constructed additively, one layer at a time. The critical nature of this layer-by-layer method of fabricating parts as well as the inherent process constraints associated with DMLS processes make it necessary for the designer to consider design for manufacturing guidelines (DFAM) during the design phase. This helps in preventing multiple iterations during the design process and avoiding excessive costs and material consumption while building the part.\n\nDesign for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) guidelines need to be considered before proceeding to building a part to avoid the problems or failures during the build. Detection of critical geometric features helps the designer to identify alternate build orientations or make appropriate modifications to the part design in the design phase to avoid any build problems downstream during the final build. The Center for Global Design and Manufacturing at the University of Cincinnati have developed a computational geometry-based preprocessing and simulation tools for assessing and iterating product designs and attributes of the additive manufacturing process in order to create a ‘digital twin.’ Those tools are seamlessly implemented in Siemens PLM NX environment using C++, NX API and Ufunc routines. Stand-alone modules with GUI’s were developed within the NX environment that allowed the students to conduct the analysis on sample geometry as shown in Figure 1.\n\nStudents were able to simulate the layer-by-layer process analysis using a virtual toolset that allows detection of several important DFAM features including small openings, thin features, sharp corners, thin to thick transitions, thin walls, and recoater arm collisions for a given part build orientation. This analysis helps the students identify problems in the existing design from a manufacturability viewpoint and make appropriate design changes before building the part in a specific orientation. This enables the user to identify manufacturability problems and correct them at the design stage thus preventing multiple iterations of manufacture.\n\nSmall openings detection\n\nSmall openings are considered as gaps within each layer whose dimensions are below the minimum manufacturable size of an opening for a given AM machine. This is due to the minimum laser spot size for a given machine. The small openings could be a hole or a narrow slot. These features may fuse during the laser sintering process depending on the laser diameter and may pose problems when building the part. So, it is important for the designer to consider the deigns that could minimize the small opening features to improve manufacturability.\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati have developed their own slice-based algorithm for identifying problematic small openings in the part model. Using the custom GUI, Students can rotate a part with adjustable threshold values and slice thickness, then the tool will detect all the small holes and gaps in the geometry. Critical small opening areas are highlighted in the CAD model, and total small opening areas is calculated and displayed as output shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: Custom GUI and result output for small opening detection in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nThin regions detection\n\nThin features are regions within each layer where the size of the feature is below the threshold value of a given AM machine. Part with thin features are challenging to manufacture with AM since the accuracy of the features is compromised due to resolution limit of an AM machine. The thin features can also cause warping or bending due to the thermal residual stress within the thin regions during AM process.\n\nThe purpose of this tool is to detect the thin features in each layer of the geometry as shown in Figure 3. Students can input the rotation angle around the x and y axes, and the threshold value of thin feature. The tool will highlight the critical thin sections in the CAD model with green color and display the total area of the thin region as result.\n\nFigure 3: Custom GUI and result output for thin feature detection in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nSharp corner detection\n\nSharp corners are identified as tips within each layer where the angle of the tip is less than threshold value of the AM machine. If the angle is too small, these sharp corners in the geometry may be difficult to manufacture during the laser sintering process due to the size of the laser diameter. This tool can rotate a part and highlights critical sharp corners in the geometry and calculate the number of the sharp corners in each layer as shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Custom GUI and result output for sharp corner detection in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nThin to thick detection\n\nThin to thick transitions are transition areas from a low area layer to a high area layer along the build direction. It’s a very important factor especially in DMLS process. Because the laser melts the metal powders and fuses them together. The heat energy in the current layer is transferred to the substrate through the layers beneath it. If the transition area between any consecutive layers is too small, it may cause thermal distortion due to impediments to heat transfer during DMLS process. This tool is designed to detect those transition areas that may pose problems. The tool can scan each layer and predict the transition layers that are too thin for heat transfer, such layers will be highlighted and shown in the CAD model, and the location of the layers will be displayed in the text. Then the designer could adjust the CAD design directly from the result. Figure 5 shows result output for thin to thick transition.\n\nFigure 5: Custom GUI and result output for thin to thick transition in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nThin walls detection\n\nThin wall is vertical wall structure where the thickness of the wall is too small. Thin walls are very challenge to manufacture duo to the laser spot diameter or FDM nozzle size. So, it is necessary to detect thin walls as they may cause build failures due to increased thermal stresses and distortion.\n\nThis tool can detect all the wall features in the geometry. The user can input the threshold thickness of the thin wall feature. The tool will display all the thin walls whose thickness is less than the threshold value on the CAD model with contrasting colors as shown in Figure 6. In addition, the location and the height of each thin wall is also shown as results.\n\nFigure 6: Custom GUI and result output for thin wall detection in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nRecoater Arm collision\n\nThe re-coater arm, which is responsible for depositing each layer of powder, may collide with the part geometry if the part has a long edge parallel to the re-coater arm. This tool can rotate a part and specify the recoater direction and identify areas of the part that may be prone to recoater damage. As shown in Figure 7, it can highlight the potential geometry/deformation areas of the parts that may be damaged due to recoater arm collision, then designer can utilize this knowledge and can come up with a better part layout plan, build orientation and part design that prevents these collisions from happening, thus preventing rebuilds and material wastage.\n\nFigure 7: Custom GUI and result output for recoater arm collision detection in Siemens NX Modeling"

This tool provides quick feedback on support structures as well as calculates parameters such as support volume, support contact area, build height, and down-facing areas (areas that do not need support structures). Because this module is developed to visualize the support structures for a particular orientation, the support structures are represented as lines for faster calculations. \n\nInstallation Manual\n\n1. Download and extract the contents of the .zip file named Support Parameter.zip.\n2. Open the extracted folder named Support Parameter.\n3. Open the folder named ug_customization. Right click on the Windows Batch File named nx and open with Notepad/Notepad++.\n4. Find the current file path of the nx file in your computer (Right click >> Properties). Copy the file path and paste it in the first line (the highlighted portion in the notepad as shown below).\n\n5. Change the version of Siemens NX to the one you are using (module works for Siemens NX 10.0, 11.0, and 12.0) in the third line of the notepad file (as highlighted below).\n\nOnce these steps are carried out, you have completed the installation procedures before launching the application.\n\nInstruction Manual\n\n6. Now, double-click nx to launch the Windows Batch File. This will launch the Siemens NX window and a terminal window (you can minimize it or close it – it contains the information you input in steps 4 and 5). You may notice the UC AM Modules tab in the top toolbar. Click on it. The Support Parameters module will be visible.\n7. Before using the module, user is supposed to import/create a Parasolid File of a part within Siemens NX. For illustration purposes, the Part File (. prt) and Parasolid File (.x_t) is given in the folder named Example Parts. Import the Parasolid file into Siemens NX. Follow the step mentioned below to import a Parasolid file of the part.\n\n\nOpen >> (Choose the file location of Support Parameter Folder) >> Example Parts >> SiemensPart2.x_t >> Ok\n\n\n\n8. Once the file is opened in Siemens NX, you can click on Support Parameter button on the Command Ribbon. The button will look like Figure 1 below.\n9. The Support Parameter GUI is shown in the adjacent figure. The detailed explanation of each option in the GUI is given below.\n\na. Select Body\nThis option is used to select the body for which support structures need to be visualized.\n\nb. Rotation along X axis\nRotation along X axis (value to be entered in degrees) will rotate the selected part along the X axis.\n\nc. Rotation along Y axis\nRotation along Y axis (value to be entered in degrees) will rotate the selected part along the Y axis.\n\n\nd. Threshold\nIt is the angle between the part surface normal and the build direction (Z axis). The default value is set to 135 degrees.\n\ne. Overhang Length\nOverhang length is the center-to-center distance between two adjacent support columns (square cross-section). It is also the side length of the cross section of the support column (square cross-section). Values ranging from 1.00 to 4.00 are optimal. A lower value will take longer computational time due to more number of support structures. A higher value of overhang length will generate fewer support structures making the solution sub-optimal.\n\nf. Support Type\nSolid Support: Each support column generated will be solid.\nHollow Support: Each support column is hollow (thickness can be entered in option\nSurface Support: Support columns are surfaces with no thickness. The minimum thickness for support structures will be the laser diameter used to sinter the material powder using DMLS.\n\ng. Hollow Thickness\nThis value provides thickness to hollow support structures.\n\nh. Add Teeth\nCheck this box if you want to create support structures with a tooth at the support to part contact region. Removal of support structures with teeth is easy and will not damage the parts during post-processing. The contact area of support structures will be less if this option is selected.\n\ni. Gap Between Supports\nThis is the side-to-side gap between two adjacent support columns. Default value is given as 1 mm. The gap between supports should always be less than the value you input in Overhang Length\n\nj. Teeth Length\nTeeth length is the side dimension of the top side of the teeth (as shaded by red in the figure). A value of zero teeth length means the support contact region is a point. Thus, the support contact area calculated will be 0 mm^2. \n\n\n10. The output window of the Support Parameter module is shown below. The results consist of build height, support contact area, support volume and the down facing areas. Down facing areas are inclined regions of the part that does not need support structures. \n\n\nPlease watch the video tutorial of the module conducted on an example part given with the module.\n\nExample Problem\n\nUse the Parasolid File named SiemensPart1.x_t in the Example Parts folder attached in the Support Parameter module folder that you have extracted from the website.\n\nTry out the following input configurations to note the changes in Build Height, Support Contact Area, Support Volume, and Down Facing Areas\n\nRotate the part along X axis by 35 degrees and rotate the part along Y axis by 50 degrees Set Threshold to default value (135 degrees).  Input Overhang Length as 2.00 mm.\nSelect Solid Support and set Gap Between Support as 1.00 mm\nSelect Hollow Support and set Hollow Thickness to 1.00 mm\nSelect Surface Support\nSelect Solid Support and check the Add Teeth Option. Set the Teeth Length as 0.5 mm\nRotate the part along X axis by 45 degrees and rotate the part along Y axis by 30 degrees Set Threshold to default value (135 degrees).  Input Overhang Length as 3.5 mm.\nSelect Solid Support and set Gap Between Support as 2.00 mm\nSelect Hollow Support and set Hollow Thickness to 2.00 mm\nSelect Surface Support\nSelect Solid Support and check the Add Teeth Option. Set the Teeth Length as 1.5 mm\n\nDownload NX API Based AM Tools"

Any violation of these regulations, including acts of plagiarism or cheating, will be dealt with on an individual basis according to the severity of the misconduct, and can result in severe consequences, including potential dismissal from the college after the second offense.\n\nAccessibility\n\nUC is committed to providing all students full and equal access to learning opportunities.  UC's Office of Accessibility Resources is the official campus office that works to arrange for reasonable accommodations for students with an identified physical, psychological, or cognitive disability (learning, ADD/ADHD, psychological, visual, hearing, physical, cognitive, medical condition, etc.).  Students are encouraged to contact the Accessibility Resources office to arrange for a confidential meeting to discuss services and accommodations.  Contact should be initiated as soon as possible to allow for adequate time for accommodations to be arranged.\n\nUC is also committed to providing full and equal access to our electronic and information technology, including websites, electronic files, digital course content, and software/applications.  If you experience difficulty in using any of the digital content associated with this course, even with the assistance of available Student Accessibility Resources, please let your instructor know.\n\nTitle IX\n\nTitle IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. Title IX also address instances of sexual violence, dating or domestic violence, and stalking. If a student discloses a Title IX issue to a faculty member, the faculty member is required to forward that information to the Title IX Office. The Title IX office will follow up with the student and discuss how the University can take steps to address the impact on the student and the community.  They will also inform the student of their rights and direct them to available resources.  The priority is to make sure students are safe and successful here at the University of Cincinnati.  Students are not required to talk to anyone in the Title IX Office. Students may also directly report any instance of sex or gender-based discrimination, harassment or violence to the Title IX office at 513-556-3349.  Students who wish to know more about their rights and resources on campus, they can consult the Title IX website or contact the Title IX office directly at 513-556-3349.\n\nCounseling Services\nStudents have access to counseling and mental health care through the University Health Services, which can provide both psychotherapy and psychiatric services. UC’s Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) provides students access to professional counseling services as well as numerous options for help online, via mobile apps, group sessions, and peer-to-peer programs. CAPS conducts free virtual consultations via the \"Let's Talk\" program.  Students are encouraged to seek assistance for anxiety, depression, trauma/assault, adjustment to college life, interpersonal/relational difficulty, sexuality, family conflict, grief and loss, disordered eating and body image, alcohol and substance abuse, anger management, identity development and issues related to diversity, concerns associated with sexual orientation and spirituality concerns, as well as any other issues of concern.\nInclusivity\n\nCEAS is committed to the fundamental principles of academic freedom and human dignity.  Diversity in all forms is something we welcome, we foster, and we prize.  We believe that honest attempts to understand the perspectives of others facilitates learning, and we will strive to achieve this goal at all times.  We strongly disavow discrimination -- including harassment -- on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex or gender identity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or veteran status.  We expect that each of us will hold one another accountable for maintaining these ideals.\n\nAll are welcome and considered a valuable addition to the university community. You should consider the classroom as an inclusive and safe space to express your ideas and viewpoints. No discrimination is accepted or tolerated. It is the goal for you to be successful and to thrive to your highest potential. UC Notice of Non-Discrimination\n\nReligious Accommodation\n\nOhio law and the University’s Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations.

We seek to dramatically increase the amount of scholarship aid available to our students.\n\nGraduate Fellowships\n\nTo attract outstanding graduate students who want to earn master's and doctorate degrees under the direction of world-class researchers, the college needs to provide graduate aid for the duration of a student's degree program.\n\nDemocratization of Simulation\n\nSimulation software has changed how engineers work in every discipline. The use of simulation software has been limited primarily to engineers with graduate degrees. We seek to broaden its usage. Undergraduates who are proficient in simulation software will have skills which future employers desire.\n\nNeil Armstrong Initiative\n\nTo honor the legacy of Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon and an aerospace professor at UC, the University has established the Neil Armstrong Initiative. Crossing many disciplines and units, the initiative will feature scholarships and fellowships for talented aerospace engineering undergraduate and graduate students, a Space to Earth Research Center and a 21st Century Information Research Center.\n\nContact Us\n\nCollege of Engineering and Applied Science\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nOffice of Development\n2901 Woodside Drive, 838 Mantei Center (ERC)\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0018\n\n\nDevelopment Staff\nMike Volan\n\nSenior Director of Development, CEAS, UC Foundation\n\nVictory Parkway Campus, Office 520, 2220 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati OH 45206\n\n(513) 556-6147\n\nmike.volan@foundation.uc.edu\n\nAlina Nosal\n\nDirector of Development, CEAS, UC Foundation\n\nVictory Parkway Campus, Office 521, 2220 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati OH 45206\n\n(513) 556-4221\n\nalina.nosal@foundation.uc.edu\n\nJillian Schneider\n\nAssistant Director of Development & Stewardship, CEAS, UC Foundation\n\nVictory Parkway Campus, Office 517, 2220 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati OH 45206\n\n(513) 556-7818\n\njillian.schneider@foundation.uc.edu\n\nJen Cahall\n\nAssociate Director of Development, CEAS, UC Foundation\n\nVictory Parkway Campus, Office 522, 2220 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati OH 45206\n\n(513) 556-1725\n\njennifer.morand@foundation.uc.edu"

This requires that students in the CEAS provide at minimum the basic computing environment that they will need for their academic program. This basic computing environment includes word processing, spreadsheet, email, network access/browse capabilities, as well as limited engineering computing capabilities (language compilers, math packages, etc.).\n\nRecommendation Rationale\n\nThe rationale for the student owned computer requirement involves many factors, some of which include:\n\n\nThe College concentrates its limited computing resources on providing workstations and engineering and applied science software required to support coursework.  The University has implemented a university-wide Information Technology and Instructional Equipment Fee which provides limited funds for these computing lab resources.  These funds are not sufficient for providing personal computing.  Students must provide their own personal computing (word processing, email, etc.) using their own computer. Personal computing on campus should be done with the use of the student’s laptop, not in the college labs.\n\nA laptop with wireless network access allows students to use their personal laptop while they are on campus, between and during classes.  If they have their own laptop with them, a student can avoid having to find an open computer system in a college computer lab.\nBy having their own laptop, students can fully benefit from the computer programs and documentation frequently delivered as part of an engineering textbook from any location.\n\nMany students already plan to own their own computers and want guidance on what hardware/software to buy.\nA laptop computer is required because a portable computer with wireless network access allows students to use their device while they are on campus, between and during classes.  If they have their own laptop with them, a student can avoid having to find an open computer system in a computer lab or returning to the location of their desktop computer.\nRequiring student ownership of hardware/software means that these costs are included in financial aid considerations.\nMinimum Requirements\n\nMinimum computer requirements are established for each group of engineering and applied science students by graduating class.  Minimum requirements are published during the spring term, before students enter CEAS, and are not changed after they are defined for a specific group of students. Due to the length of the academic program (5 years) and the required cooperative work assignments, there are many reasons for considering a purchase that exceeds the minimum college requirement.\n\nThese requirements are the minimum requirements for students in CEAS.  Individual programs and departments may have additional requirements for their students.\n\nDetailed information describing the minimum hardware and software required for each graduating class of students is listed at:\n\nMinimum Computer Requirement by Year\nTiming of Computer Purchase and Minimum Requirement\n\nStudents are required to have their own laptop at the beginning of their freshman year or at the time of their transfer into the college.\n\n\nComputer Vendor Considerations\n\nThe University has made special arrangements with selected computer vendors to provide customized computers which meet or exceed the minimum hardware requirements.  Students are not required to buy their computer from these companies but should consider these offerings to help determine pricing of a properly equipped and supported system. The most up-to-date information on the offerings is maintained at:\n\nUC DTS - Hardware Discounts"

This will allow students to avoid having to use laser printing in computer labs and exceeding their print quotas.\n\nPrinting Tips\nIt is advised that students submit their print jobs only after the present print job has finished printing. By submitting too many jobs at a time, there is a possibility that the Queues will be overloaded.\nIf you have very large files to print, it is advised that it be broken down into smaller files if possible and then sent to the release terminal for printing.\nMobile Printing\n\nMobile printing to OCC lab printers is available in Mantei Center (ERC) 617 and Bald 860 labs when connected through UC_Secure or Secure VPN.  A PaperCut Web Print feature allows users to print from their own laptops and netbooks. With the Web Print feature, users do not have to install any driver, nor any printer on their personal devices. It uses a simple  web interface to submit print jobs without having to use any of the lab computers. \n\nSee the following link for instructions on how to use this feature: \n\n\nPAPERCUT MOBILE PRINTING\nColor Printing\n\nA quota of 300 pages per semester is provided. Color laser printers are available in 636 Mantei Center (ERC) for printing student thesis and CEAS course projects. Come to 636 Mantei Center (ERC) to request this service.  Office hours are Monday - Friday 8:00AM - 5:00PM\n\n\nColor Plotting\n\nAccess to a 42\" color plotter is available in 617 Mantei Center (ERC). The plotter is for use only if faculty require students to produce color plots for scheduled CEAS class projects. Come to 636 Mantei Center (ERC) to request this service.\n\nThe plotter printer is for use only if faculty require students to produce color plots for scheduled CEAS class projects.  \n\nTo significantly cut down on wasted ink and paper, as well as wasted time spent collecting project files/advising students on how to save as a PDF, the process outlined below has been put in place. This will allow OCC and the professors to plan appropriately for poster prints, which shall help ensure all students get their posters printed. It will decrease supply costs significantly, and reduce man-hours spent on printing posters.\n\nPlotter Printing Process\nThe professor/TA notifies OCC by sending an email to CEAS-USERHELP@listserv.uc.edu at least two weeks prior to an upcoming plotting job for the CEAS course. This would include the number of plots that will be required for that assignment. Based on this information, OCC will work with the professor to schedule a deadline for submitting the PDF files to OCC and determine their preferred method of delivering the files to OCC.\n\nThe professor/TA of the class requiring the poster to be printed collects all of the PDF formatted poster files. Once all the students have submitted their files to the professor/TA, the professor/TA forwards them to OCC for final printing. This can be done by shared network storage, Cloud storage, USB Drive, or even DVD.\nOCC will complete the print jobs, collect all of the posters printed and store them in Mantei Center (ERC) 628.\nThe students may then pick up their print jobs according to the date provided."

The integration and collaboration of these two predecessor colleges —The College of Engineering and The College of Applied Science — does not diminish the legacy or stature of either unit but offers numerous opportunities for positive change. Each entity brings a rich history with exceptional and often complementary strengths.\n\n\nPrior to Restructuring: College of Engineering\n\nThe College of Engineering has always been part of the university’s history. The appointment of a professor of civil engineering in 1874 and the organization of a department of engineering, culminated in the establishment of the College of Engineering in 1900.\n\nStudents in machine shop class, ~1911\n\nUC’s College of Engineering is heralded as the founding institution of cooperative education (co-op). In 1906, under the direction of then Dean Herman Schneider, the college began requiring its students to work and attend classes in alternating periods. This combination proved so successful in preparing graduates for their later careers that more than 1,000 schools offer forms of the program today.\n\nIn 1923 a six-year cooperative program was added in general engineering which led to dual degrees: a bachelor of engineering and a master of science. The college began offering courses in engineering through its own evening division in 1924 and by 1926 grew to include course work in applied arts.\n\nThe Institute for Scientific Research, established in the 1920s, expanded the concept of cooperative education by joining the university with industry at the research level.\n\nElectrical engineering students in motor lab, ~1930\n\nThe goal in the 1950s was to offer graduate instruction in every department. A joint project with the Engineer’s Council for Professional Development (ECPD), and local industry provided opportunities for young professional engineers to pursue graduate degrees without leaving their jobs.\n\nEngineering Library quiet room\n\nDuring the late 50s, fueled by the Cold War, advanced studies in engineering and research became the focus. Every department expanded to accommodate the need. In the decades to follow other research programs emerged to strengthen the college’s focus on graduate education.\n\n\nPrior to Restructuring: College of Applied Science\n\nThe Ohio Mechanics Institute (OMI), parent name of the College of Applied Science, was founded in 1828 as a private educational institution and the first school west of the Alleghenies dedicated to technical education. The institute became a regional technology resource boosting the Cincinnati economy in the late 1800s.\n\nOMI operated exclusively as an evening college until 1901 when day courses on a pre-college level were added. In 1919 the day courses were revised into collegiate programs. In 1934 the cooperative education plan, where students could spend time working in industry, was initiated. \n\nIn 1958 the college designated separate names for its day and evening operations, the day school became the Ohio College of Applied Science (OCAS) and the evening school was named the Ohio Mechanics Institute Evening College (OMIEC). The college merged with the University of Cincinnati in 1969 and offered programs in the engineering technologies and related areas with the aim of preparing individuals for careers as engineering technologists, engineering technicians, and managers in industry.  The college began offering bachelor’s degrees in the early 70s.\n\nThe name of the college was changed in 1978 to the OMI College of Applied Science, combining the day and evening divisions, and was shortened to the College of Applied Science in 2000.\n\nBoth colleges and the City of Cincinnati have shared long and productive partnerships. From the earliest days to the present the Colleges of Engineering and Applied Science have maintained strong ties to local and national industry through cooperative education assignments, research funding and graduate placement.  The University of Cincinnati honors the distinguished history and traditions of these two colleges, now strengthened by their union.\n\nThe Analemma\n\nThe sun-clock that sits in the engineering quadrangle was a gift from the Class of 1955 designed by two chemical engineering students, Ron Rosensweig and Hans Mueller.  Hand-made almost entirely of brass, the sun-clock weighed thirty-five pounds and was manufactured for the price of $500 by the Rief Manufacturing Company in Fairfax, Ohio. Owing to the precision of its design and manufacture, the sun-clock’s hand chiseled analemma—the graduated scale shaped in a figure eight showing the sun’s declination and the equation of time for each day of the year—could tell time within one minute’s accuracy.  In recent years college staff have referred to the entire instrument as simply the \"analemma.”\n\nThroughout its years on the quad, mishaps and thefts plagued the clock to the point that in 1968 all of the instrument’s moving parts disappeared. The sun-clock was irreparable because Rosensweig and Mueller, who designed the clock, had long since graduated and the college did not have any blueprints or any sketches to work from. Several employees in the UC Physical Plant worked together to consult with the original designers and secure funding to replace the sun-clock. Rosensweig, who had become president of Ferrofluidics Corporation in Burlington, Massachusetts, was quick to offer to redesign the sun-clock from square one in the absence of the original plans and sent a completed drawing for an estimate to Rief Manufacturing Company. Despite the considerable increase in cost to replace the original, the efforts of many persons culminated in success in July of 1970 when the new sun-clock was mounted on its pedestal with a plaque next to it reading, “There is Time for Those Who Pass.”\n\nFor over 50 years the analemma has remained a visible reminder of engineering and technology accomplishment and will continue to distinguish the College of Engineering and Applied Science at UC.  As a lasting symbol of dedicated service and demonstrated ability the analemma was chosen by the dean of the college as a special recognition piece awarded to carefully chosen individuals who represent the epitome of engineering and technology excellence and service to the community, their chosen careers, the college of engineering and applied science and the university.  Individuals awarded the analemma pin are, and will remain, loyal and trusted friends of the college and the dean’s inner circle of valued advisors and confidants."

Each project will require 1–2 students. Each applicant will need to indicate their top three research projects he/she is interested in the application.\n\nProject 1: Robust Deep-learning-based Side-Channel Attacks\n\nProject Advisors: Drs. Boyang Wang and John M Emmert\n\nBackground. A side-channel attack can infer the secret key on a device (e.g., a microcontroller) by analyzing power consumption or electromagnetic emission when the device runs encryption algorithms, such as Advanced Standard Encryption. While countermeasures (e.g., random delays, hiding, and masking) have been proposed to defend against traditional side-channel attacks, including Differential Power Analysis and Correlation Power Analysis, recent deep-learning-based side-channel attacks can defeat these existing countermeasures. Despite the promising results reported in recent studies, deep-learning-based side-channel attacks are not robust as they are sensitive to discrepancy between training data and test data due to different attack setups in the real world. For instance, a deep neural network trained by power traces generated by one defense (e.g., random delays) does not derive high accuracy in recovering a secret key when test power traces are produced by a different defense (e.g., masking).\n\nProject Goal. The goal of this project is to build a deep neural network that is robust (i.e., achieving high accuracy) when training data and test data are significantly different. The students will (1) examine multiple deep neural network models, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks and Recursive Neural Networks, in side-channel attacks and experimentally compare which neural network is more robust over different datasets; (2) leverage data augmentation methods to produce additional synthetic training data to mitigate the discrepancy between training data and test data.\n\nProject 2: Firmware Reverse Engineering for Trojan Detection on FPGAs\n\nProject Advisors: Drs. John M Emmert and Boyang Wang\n\nBackground. The designs of commercial Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) often include third-party intellectual properties (IPs). These third-party IPs can be in the form of hard coded and obfuscated modules that are inserted into primary product code or firmware. It is possible for untrusted agents/entities to compromise the integrity of third-party IPs without end users’ knowledge by adding Trojan circuits. The hidden Trojan circuits can be utilized to leak sensitive information, degrade the capability of the application running on an FPGA, or turn off the application running on an FPGA.\n\nProject Goal The goal of this project is to further develop a generalizable, target-independent, and standardized framework to reverse engineer FPGA bitstreams to detect Trojan circuits in third-party IPs. The student will leverage bitstream download and read-back capabilities available on FPGAs (IEEE Joint Test Action Group 1149.x compliant) to develop a technology-independent framework to load and extract programming data to and from FPGA bitstream files. Specifically, the student will enhance a logic-to-bitstream mapping flow to create an interconnected sea of Look Up Tables, which is correlated with the FPGA programming bit file. To map FPGA logic to bitstreams, the students will utilize binary patterns to systematically match portions of FPGA programmable logic fabric to the programming bit file. The students will also optimize the binary patterns to minimize the number of bitstream downloads required to reverse engineer key portions of FPGA logic.\n\nProject 3: Automatically Detecting Vulnerabilities in Source Code against Fault Injection Attacks\n\nProject Advisors: Drs. Nan Niu, Will Hawkins, and Boyang Wang\n\nBackground. A fault injection attack (also referred to as glitch attack) is a physical attack on data and behavior of an embedded device by changing the voltage, temperature or electromagnetic radiation. For example, it takes one fault to change a Boolean value from 0 to 1 (or 1 to 0) to bypass secure boot, extract a secret key, or extract firmware from an embedded device. To mitigate fault injection attacks, one effective way at the software layer is to write secure code that is more robust against the attacks. For instance, Boolean values in an if statement (e.g., if (flag == 0)) can be easily modified by fault injection attacks while using non-trivial numerical values (e.g., if (flag == 0x3CA5)) can make the attacks more difficult.\n\nProject Goal. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic method to detect lines in C code that are vulnerable under fault injection attacks. The students will (1) study secure code patterns; (2) leverage static program analysis (e.g., control flow graph) and tools (e.g., ANTLR and Joern) to automatically identify vulnerabilities.\n\nProject 4: System-on-Chip Emulation for Run-Time Security Validation\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Ranga Vemuri\n\nBackground. Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs involve combining various intellectual property (IP) components with complex communication infrastructure and protocols. Due to economics of design, verification, fabrication, testing, and integration, SoC supply chain is distributed over multiple companies and even countries. Throughout the lifecycle of the design, various security vulnerabilities can be introduced into the design. These vulnerabilities result from design flaws in the IP cores or protocols, malicious add-ons in the third party IP cores, defects introduced during the manufacturing process, and malicious insertions at untrusted foundries. The security validation of SoCs is essential due to their adoptions in critical applications and devices. Information flow properties are essential to identify security vulnerabilities in SoC designs. However, verifying information flow properties, such as integrity and confidentiality, is challenging, as these properties cannot be handled directly using traditional assertion-based verification techniques.\n\nProject Goal. The goal of this project is to develop an FPGA platform for SoC emulation with the specific objective of implementing and demonstrating run-time security monitors based on information flow tracking. The students will investigate two novel approaches, including a universal method and a property-driven method, to verify and monitor information flow properties. Both methods can be leveraged for formal verification, dynamic verification during simulation, post-fabrication validation, and run-time monitoring. In addition, the universal method can expedite implementing the information flow model. The property-driven method can reduce the overhead of the security model, which speeds up the verification process and creates an efficient run-time hardware monitor.\n\nProject 5: Efficient Countermeasures against Side-Channel Attacks on Embedded Deep Learning\n\nProject Advisors: Dr. Boyang Wang and Anca Ralescu\n\nBackground. Embedded deep learning runs the predictions of a neural network locally on embedded devices (e.g., microcontrollers). Compared to traditional server-based approaches, it eliminates network delay and reduces bandwidth consumption. Embedded deep learning has gained popularity in many emerging applications, such as voice recognition and autonomous vehicles. However, recent studies show that an attacker can recover the parameters of a neural network deployed on embedded systems by leveraging side-channel attacks. The parameters are considered as private intellectual properties because a company often spends enormous amounts of resources and efforts to label data and fine-tune the parameters. While traditional countermeasures against side-channel attacks, such as hiding and masking, can be directly applied to protect these intellectual properties, they introduce significant overheads. Specifically, as a neural network contains millions of parameters, hiding/masking all the parameters dramatically increase time delay and power consumption on embedded devices.\n\nProject Goal. The goal of this project is to develop an efficient countermeasure against side-channel attacks on embedded deep learning. The main idea is to selectively protect more important parameters rather than protecting all of them. Specifically, the students will first investigate methods (e.g., neuron ranking) to identify which neurons and their corresponding parameters are more significant than others. Next, the students will apply hiding/masking to the parameters of top-ranked neurons only.\n\nProject 6: Detection of Accelerated Aging Attacks on Integrated Circuits Using On-Chip Neuromorphic Computing\n\nProject Advisor: Dr. Rashmi Jha\n\nBackground. Aging and reliability issues in microelectronics Integrated Circuits (ICs) based on advanced Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies are becoming a topic of major concerns. The aging of ICs is dependent on the operating conditions which makes it very difficult to have a standard technique to predict. Additionally, the variabilities of ICs, temperature, and voltage make it difficult to predict the aging and remaining useful life of circuits accurately. Since aging introduces a major vulnerability, attackers can also exploit this vulnerability to cause accelerated aging. The existing techniques based on critical path delay monitoring, ring-oscillators, and Built-In Self-Test based monitoring introduce significant overheads. In addition, they are not able to distinguish differences between normal aging and accelerated aging introduced by Trojan insertions.\n\nProject Goal. The goal of this project is to enable on-chip machine-learning-based analysis over data from aging sensors to distinguish normal aging (benign) from accelerated aging (malicious) introduced by Trojan insertions. Typically, the implementation of on-chip machine learning is a challenging task due to limited resources on chips. The students will address this challenge by implementing machine learning using Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based neuromorphic hardware. Next, the students will integrate the hardware on pre-fabricated ICs leveraging heterogeneous integration techniques and utilize it to analyze remaining useful life of ICs based on data from aging sensors."

The goal of the program is to make students aware of opportunities for careers in research. These opportunities are for outstanding first-year students to work with leading CEAS research faculty in their faculty labs during the summer after their first year in CEAS.\n\nThe program initially included five to six students per year but in 2016, the program was expanded to eleven students and included research at industrial and governmental partners. The program has been administered by a committee of senior faculty members (J. Boerio, T. Mantei, and R. Huston)\n\n\nLearn more about undergraduate research\n\nFor more information concerning Protégé, contact:\nDr. James Boerio, f.james.boerio@uc.edu\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Protege program enhances the student experience by having them learn to conduct research, work as part of a team, keep laboratory notebooks, write reports, and make presentations.\n\nIn addition, students are paid at the rate of $15.00 per hour for 40 hours of work each week between 12-15 weeks in the summer. The length of the program is at the discretion of the mentor, 12 week being the minimum.\n\nThe opportunity allows students to determine if they wish to pursue a co-op position and career in research. At the same time, participating industrial and governmental partners have an early opportunity to recruit highly talented and motivated student researchers.\n\n\nSelection Process\n\nEach spring, first year CEAS students who performed at a high level during the autumn semester are identified by a CEAS faculty committee. Most participating students have grade point averages of 3.75. Students are interviewed to determine interest in research careers and availability to work in Cincinnati or at the location of an industrial or governmental partner over the summer.\n\nInterviews are conducted by the CEAS faculty committee and by participating partners in which a diverse groups of students are selected.\n\n\nExpectations\nReport for work at appropriate times\nLearn as much as possible about your project\nShow interest in and enthusiasm for the project\nDo good research\nParticipate in professional development workshops offered by UC\nSubmit a short mid-summer report\nSubmit a short final report\nParticipate in final symposium\nDon't work more than forty (40) hours per week!\nContact Dr. James Boerio, (f.james.boerio@uc.edu) if there are any problems\nTypes of Research Projects\n\nResearch projects that are involved with the Protege program must advance the state of knowledge or understanding in a particular field. Students do not usually define the project and are defined by the mentors. These are not make-work projects. Protege students usually contribute to an important, larger project that are usually funded by some agency or industry that are important to the company.

    "html": "College of Engineering and Applied Science » Research » Undergraduate Research » UPRISE Research Program » Student FAQ\n\nSet Navigation title in component\nAreas of Impact\nCenters & Labs\nUndergraduate Research\nUPRISE Research Program\nStudent FAQ\nFaculty FAQ\nPeople\nCurrent Projects\nProtege Research Program\nUndergraduate Research Co-op Fellowship (URCF)\nEntrepreneurial Co-op Program\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates in Hardware and Embedded Systems Security and Trust (RHEST)\nResearch Internships in Science and Engineering in Germany\nStudent Frequently Asked Questions\nWho is eligible for the UPRISE program?\n\nUPRISE is open to UC undergraduates (domestic and international) who are rising sophomores through rising seniors and who have a passion for both STEMM research and who have a sincere desire to make impactful contributions to underrepresented communities through advocating for inclusivity and bridging the gap in STEMM representation. In the UPRISE application, students will be asked to reflect on these and discuss how they have inspired a desire to participate in the UPRISE program.  \n\nWhen is the application deadline, and when will I find out if I have been accepted?\n\nThe student application portal will open on January 2, 2024, and applications can be found here <link to application page>. The application deadline for the 2024 program is February 26, 2024. Decisions are usually shared with students in mid- to late-March.\n\nHow does the application review process work? How am I matched to a project?\n\nStudent applications are reviewed by the UPRISE committee. The committee first identifies students that should be admitted to the program (UPRISE can typically support 20 students each summer). The UPRISE Committee will conduct a holistic application review to evaluate a student’s potential for success in the program. Factors considered include GPA, a student’s potential for research (as described in their letters of recommendation), and their personal statement. In their personal statement students will explain why representation is important in STEMM fields, barriers that restrict access to STEMM disciplines, how this impacts them and/or individuals with similar life experiences, and how the UPRISE program can help them to achieve their academic and long-term career goals. Then, using information provided on the student application, as well as mentor feedback, students are matched with projects and mentors. Because not every student can be matched with their first choice of project we ask that you list two-three projects that you would be interested in working on.\n\nHow do I choose a project?\n\nYou should review the project descriptions listed here. After identifying projects that you are interested in, you should arrange to set up a meeting with the faculty mentor. This meeting will help you assess whether the project is a good fit for you. It will also allow the mentor to determine if you are a good fit for the project—you should treat this meeting like a job interview (we use mentor feedback to match students to projects.\n\n\n \n\nCan I request to work on a project if I have not met with the faculty mentor?\n\nNo, you must meet with the faculty mentor in order to list that project on your application. We will not match you to a project if you have not met with the mentor before submitting your application. Remember—faculty can be busy, so it is wise to set these meetings up early in the semester, and not right before the application deadline.\n\nWhat are the requirements for the UPRISE program?\n\nParticipants commit to 40 hours of research effort per week on their designated projects during the program period (May 6 - July 26, 2024). Participants also must attend weekly UPRISE workshops (these typically take place Monday mornings, from 9-11). At the end of the program participants give a formal research presentation and submit a research report summarizing their project.\n\n\nThe application says that I must include unofficial transcripts. How do I do that?\n\nYou can access your unofficial transcript via Catalyst.\n\nThe application says that two letters of recommendation are needed. Who are the best people to ask for these letters?\n\nThese letters must comment on your research potential. As such, letters from employers are unlikely to carry much weight (unless you are working in a research position). Your professors are excellent individuals to write these letters, as they can comment on your academic skills. Even if they have not observed you in a research capacity they can usually make an assessment of your likely research potential. One or both letters can come from the faculty mentors that you interview with. However, if the first time that these mentors meet you is in your interview, they may not have a lot to say about you. Letters from high-school teachers may not serve you well, since the letters need to comment on your research potential, a key input we are seeking in a UPRISE recommendation. Letters from friends or classmates are not acceptable.\n\nCan I take classes or work at a part-time job during the summer while I am in the UPRISE program?\n\nUnfortunately, no. The program requires your full-time commitment on your research project—no concurrent course work is permitted. However, if you are an engineering student, and register for COOP2011 (see FAQ #10 below), your UPRISE experience can count towards your co-op credits. \n\nWill the UPRISE program impact my financial aid?\n\nThe pay that you receive from UPRISE is classified as a stipend. All students participating in the UPRISE Program are highly encouraged to register for COOP 2011, and all students who register will have the tuition fee for this one-hour course will be waived. This will mitigate the impact to financial aid for most students. However, it is important to review your aid eligibility, and the impact of this award with staff at One Stop prior to accepting this funding and to review information on the Financial Aid website.\n\nHow will UPRISE impact me as an international student?\n\nBecause UPRISE students are highly encouraged to register for the summer COOP 2011 course, international students who do so will need to complete a CPT request with International Student Services. To avoid any impact to your Visa, international students must have completed their CPT request prior to the start of the UPRISE summer session. Your experience with UPRISE will utilize available CPT time. Please note that if you use 356 days of CPT over the course of your co-ops, you will be ineligible for OPT. Please consider this, and contact International Student Services for more information. \n\nOur family has already scheduled a summer vacation during the UPRISE program period—will I be able to join them?\n\nIf this is unavoidable, and is for no more than one week, you may be permitted to begin your research earlier than the scheduled start date so as to ensure that you contribute to the full 12 weeks of research time. All arrangements for this must be discussed and approved in advance by your research mentor.\n\nDoes UPRISE provide accommodation for housing or provide reimbursement for parking?\n\nUnfortunately, UPRISE does not have the funds to support student housing, or to provide transportation/parking vouchers. However, you may consider applying for an Undergraduate Research Fellowship to help offset these costs. \n\nThe University of Cincinnati does not discriminate on the basis of disability, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, parental status (including status as a foster parent), sex, age, sexual orientation, veteran status, military status (past, present, or future), or gender identity and expression in its programs and activities.\n\nQuestions?

How do I submit a project description?\n\nYou will submit a brief (250-300) word abstract of your project using our project portal. Your abstract should generally describe the research the student will be conducting, why it is significant, skills the ideal student will need, and skills they will develop while conducting this research.  Some faculty submit a description for a specific project, others outline general areas of research that the student could conduct in their lab. Both are acceptable. Please make sure that your project description is understandable to an undergraduate student. Project applications will be reviewed by the UPRISE director and then posted to the UPRISE website, where students can view them.\n\nAs a faculty mentor, am I responsible for the UPRISE student stipend?\n\nFaculty mentors contribute 50% of the student stipend ($2,250). The UPRISE program contributes the other 50%. Mentor funds can come sources such as departmental or college funds as well as grants. Please note that NIH funding does not allow for grant funding to be used towards scholarships and fellowships. The stipend that UPRISE students receive falls under this category of educational assistance.\n\nHow are students selected for the UPRISE program? How much of a voice do I have in selecting the UPRISE student that I would mentor?\n\nApplicants to UPRISE are evaluated by the UPRISE committee, which will select  up to 20 students to be admitted to the program each year. The UPRISE Committee will conduct a holistic application review to evaluate a student’s potential for success in the program. Factors considered include GPA, a student’s potential for research (as described in their letters of recommendation), and their personal statement. In their personal statement students will reflect on their how their life experiences and background inspire the desire to participate in UPRISE, and how the program can help them to achieve their academic and long-term career goals.  \n\nPrior to submitting their UPRISE application, students will also meet and interview with faculty mentors that they are interested in working with. The UPRISE committee will solicit faculty feedback from mentors on these interviews, and will use that information, as well as student information about project preference, to match accepted students to specific mentors and projects. \n\nI am planning to travel over the summer—can I still mentor a student in the UPRISE program?\n\nOne of the strengths of the UPRISE program is the mentorship that students receive. While we recognize that students may have multiple mentors in their research lab (including postdocs and advanced graduate students), you will be their primary faculty mentor. With that in mind, we ask that you make every effort to be a consistent presence during the UPRISE program. However, travel is often inevitable (especially in the summer)—if you will be away from the lab make sure that your UPRISE student has a clear plan for how to conduct research in your absence and a designated person to check in with. If you are going to be away for a substantial amount of the program period then this may not be the best summer to take on an UPRISE student.\n\nQuestions? Contact Us\nTiffany J.

Although there have been several studies characterizing diabetic-associated changes in fibroblast phenotype and inadequate matrix deposition, not much is known about the effects of diabetes on the phenotype of ECs and their angiogenic potentials.  This information is important to develop new therapies that enhance angiogenesis and healing of chronic diabetic ulcers. Our previous studies demonstrated that a self-assembling peptide nanoscaffold provides an angiogenic environment that enhances survival of endothelial cells and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of type II diabetes.  However, in order to fully utilize the potential of the nanoscaffold for development of treatment for diabetic ulcers in human patients, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of its action, especially with ECs.  Thus the objectives of this study are:\n\nTo compare the difference in angiogenic potential between the diabetic and non-diabetic microvascular endothelial cells,\n\nTo elucidate how the peptide nanoscaffold interacts with the microvascular endothelial cells to enhance the angiogenesis."

An adequate blood supply to and within the newly grown tissue is an essential factor for the tissue survival and functioning. While considerable success has been achieved in growing artificial arteries, generating a functional microvasculature remains one of the major challenges in tissue engineering. The difficulties arise mainly from the complexity of the local cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling involved in the process of capillary formation (angiogenesis), which is not completely understood. In addition, the Extracellular microenvironment varies with the site and disease, making it extremely difficult to study angiogenesis using in vitro models. Therefore, there is need for new approaches to dissect the mechanisms involved in capillary growth and to restore or generate microvasculature in a particular clinical application.\n\n The underlying concept of our research is that the process of capillary formation can be controlled through the manipulation of the Extracellular environment. This approach is based on using an appropriate scaffold to provide capillary (endothelial) and support cells (such as fibroblasts) with necessary mechanical and chemical signals. We have recently developed a new model to study angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, which uses a novel biomaterial – a self-assembling peptide scaffold – to support spontaneous angiogenesis in vitro and capillary growth in vivo. The important advantages of this material over other scaffolds are 1) the ability to control scaffold physical properties, 2) fast self-assembly under physiological conditions both in vitro and in vivo, 3) support of growth of many cell types, 4) possibility of in vivo delivery via injection with no detectable immune response and 5) possibility of controlled delivery of angiogenic factors in vivo. Therefore, this system enables one to customize the scaffold for a particular application.\n\nCurrent Research Projects\nHealing of Chronic Diabetic Ulcers \nIschaemic Tissue Revascularization\nComparing the difference in angiogenic potential between diabetic and non-diabetic microvacular endothelial cells\nEffects of High frequency Electromagnetic fields on Cell-Cell communication"

Commercially available and in-house software tools are used to simulate fluid interactions via high performance computing and data driven modeling.\n\nCurrent Research\n\nLiquid-vapor phase change is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered devices. It’s happening around us – all the time. The cup of coffee, the tree outdoor, the AC unit indoor, they are all undergoing “evaporation” in some form. Curved surfaces (such as droplets and bubbles) exhibit unique properties due to surface tension that alters evaporation. In turn, the evaporation further deforms and moves the interface. At UCLID, we focus on liquid-vapor phase change and associated interfacial dynamics. We study multi-phase transport phenomena using a combination of visualization tools, theory, and modeling. We work on a variety of topics including but not limited to boiling, condensation, dehumidification, evaporative deposition, colloidal self-assembly, porous media transport, electronics cooling, cryogenics, variable-gravity fluid management, and nano-/micro-scale heat transfer.\n\nOpen Positions\n\nUCLID is hiring!

The object to be plated may be masked to ensure electro deposition on specific areas on its surface. Electro deposition is based on the principle of electrolysis. Wide range of electrolytic solutions are being used including contain salts of metals and can be buffered to control the pH level.\n\nIn our pursuit of exploring more potential applications of existing electroplating processes, UCMAN uses the principles of electroplating to fabricate micro diamond abrasive tools. Availability of accurate micro abrasive tools is an essential requirement in the development of an efficient multi-material micro manufacturing system. Micro system products are increasingly using advanced engineering materials such as ceramics and fiber reinforced composites. Existing micromachining processes are not adequate for micromachining electrically non-conductive and inert materials. Micro-grinding is a potential technique for micromachining of such materials. Commercially available micro abrasive tools are typically limited to sizes above 800 μm, with single layer of abrasives only. Our ongoing research aims to fabricate multilayered micro abrasive tools with diameter below 100 μm, for efficient machining performance and longer tool life.\n"

They occupy less space, and consume less energy and material. They can be cheaper. Hence there is a strong demand for miniaturized components from diverse industries such as electronics, optics, medical, biotechnology, automotive, communications, and avionics industries.

Lithography-based micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication technologies are capable of producing micro and sub-micrometer size features. However the MEMS techniques have limitations such as restricted choice of work materials (mostly semi-conductor materials), inability to produce complex geometries, huge capital investment and inevitable cleanroom environment. Extreme operating conditions (e.g. high temperature and corrosiveness in exhaust nozzle) demand the use of materials with excellent physical properties such as high fatigue life, high wear resistance, and inertness to corrosion and chemical reactions.  These advanced engineering materials due to their exceptional properties such as high hardness, brittleness and/or chemical inertness pose serious machinability challenges, as conventional micromachining methods are found to be inadequate to machine these materials.\n\nIn addition to the material properties mentioned above, multi-material micro and nano machining faces additional challenges such as lack of adequate education/training, material handling issues, absence of metrology standards and demand for miniaturized  high aspect ratio and complex freeform surfaces.\n\nMicro and nano manufacturing laboratory is committed to innovate, develop and apply cutting edge multi-functional, multi-scale, multi-material processing technologies for reliable and affordable manufacturing solutions across size domains, and educate students on the state-of-the-art in manufacturing science."

Decentralized control technologies are being developed.\n\nApproach\n\nDevelop intelligent adaptable control strategies for each of the independently controlled robots in the group through reinforcement techniques such as Genetic Fuzzy and Reinforcement Learning algorithms that can learn from practice data (i.e., enabling robot gain knowledge like a human). The assumption is that each robot is unaware of how the other robots will act at any instant but it knows the group’s current state and goal.\n\nAdvantages\n\nInter-agent communication is not required; easily scalable for a larger problem or more agents; process and even performance unaffected when dropping one or several agents; can be trained under uncertainties for improving robustness.\n\nApplications\nA group of air and/or land robots working collaboratively to achieve a common goal.\nMultiple robots carry or manipulate a large piece of hardware\nMultiple robots jointly perform an assembly/construction task\nTraining for optimal behavioral strategy through simulation\nFirst Case Study\n\nEach robot of the 5-robot team makes its own decision to pull a cable to make the cables’ common end chase a dynamic target. Each robot does not communicate with others but it knows the team goal. The team members can increase or decrease without re-training.\n\nSecond Case Study\n\nTwo distributed robots each (by making own decision) carrying one end of a rod to take the rod out of the room without collision with obstacles, with Genetic fuzzy based learning technology for the distributed multi-agent system.\n\nPublications\nSathyan, A. and Ma, O., “Collaborative Decentralized Control of Multiple Robots Using Genetic Fuzzy Systems”, Robotica, 2019, DOI: 10.1017/S0263574719000353​\nSathyan, A.; Cohen, K.; and Ma, O.; “Comparison Between Genetic Fuzzy Methodology and Q-Learning for Collaborative Control Design”, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Vol.10, No.2, March 2019.​\nSun Y., Barth A. and Ma O., “An Intelligent Approach for a Two-robot Team to Perform a Cooperative Task”, Proceedings of AIAA SciTech, Jan 6-10, 2020, Orlando, FL."

The group primarily focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of these manufacturing techniques using Molecular Dynamic Simulations (MDS). Unlike macro scale manufacturing most of the micro and nano scale manufacturing process mechanisms are impossible to be examined by naked eye and thus provide a huge barrier in understanding the exact process mechanisms and influence of process parameters on these mechanisms. While theory could provide an insight to the mechanism, the very nature of these processes demand real time computation beyond the reach of most of the theoretical methods and hence fall into the domain of computer simulations. Molecular dynamics group at UCMAN uses MDS techniques to visualize the fundamental process mechanisms by computing forces on all the atoms in the simulation cell at every time step (time integration) by predefined potentials (atomic interaction parameters).\n\nPrevious work at UCMAN includes development of a novel nano manufacturing technique VANILA process (Vibration Assisted Nano-Impact-Machining by Loose Abrasives). Furthermore this novel manufacturing technique was analyzed using MDS to study tool wear, material removal rate, the effect of impact velocity, particle size and angle of impact of abrasive grain on the work piece. The results thus obtained are experimentally validated and published.\n\n\nFigure 1 Modes of material removal during the VNILS process obtained through MD simulation (a) Cone crack (b) Plastic deformation (c) Plastic deformation + Cone crack (d) Plastic deformation + Cone crack + Lateral crack (e) Cone crack + Lateral crack and (f) Transition"

Efforts including the National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) and VaNTH Engineering Research Center in Bioengineering Educational Technologies have been made to establish and disseminate knowledge and proven methods for teaching bioengineering concepts. Further, the summer bioengineering conference (SBC), sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers’ (ASME) Bioengineering Division, was established to provide a meeting place for engineering educators and students having common interests in biological systems. Of the many sub-disciplines of bioengineering, biotransport is a key subject that has wide applicability to many issues in engineering, biology, medicine, pharmacology, and environmental science, among others. The absence of standard content, guidelines, and texts needed for teaching biotransport courses to students motivated the Biotransport committee of ASME’s Bioengineering Division to establish a biotransport education initiative. Biotransport education workshop sessions were conducted during the SBC 2011, 2012, and 2013 as part of this initiative. The workshop sessions included presentations from experienced faculty covering a spectrum of information from general descriptions of undergraduate biotransport courses to very detailed outlines of graduate courses to successful teaching techniques. A list of texts and references available for teaching biotransport courses at undergraduate and graduate levels has been collated and documented based on the workshop presentations. Further, based on individual teaching experiences and methodologies shared by the presenters, it was noted that active learning techniques, including cooperative and collaborative learning, can be useful for teaching undergraduate courses while problem based learning (PBL) can be a beneficial method for graduate courses. The outcomes of the education initiative will help produce students who are knowledgeable in thesubject of biotransport, facile in applying biotransport concepts for solving problems in various application areas, and comfortable with their own abilities as life-long learners.\n\nPhysiological flows: Clinical, In vivo, In vitro, Computational blood-artery dynamics\nExpand AllCollapse All\nCoronary artery and microvascular disease diagnostics \nCongenital Heart Disease \nHemodialysis Vascular Dysfunction \nAortic Valve Disease  \nPeripheral Vascular Disease \nMedical devices and stents \nPeristalsis \nThermal Therapy\nExpand AllCollapse All\nHigh intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation \nRadio frequency (RF) ablation \nLaser Photocoagulation \nTissue preservation \nHuman whole body heat transfer \nDrug delivery and mass transport\nExpand AllCollapse All\nOcular drug delivery \nOxygen transport in vasculature \nIn-Vitro Cell Culture Study \nTumor and Spinal \nOxygen-dependent gene expression in microgravity \nMicro- and nano- fluidic heat transfer\nExpand AllCollapse All\nElectro-hydrodynamics \nMagneto-electro hydrodynamics \nTissue and cell mechanics\nExpand AllCollapse All\nVibration induced tissue damage \nMacro-fluidics and heat transfer\nExpand AllCollapse All\nResearch Areas \nEducation\nExpand AllCollapse All\nBioengineering "

    "html": "Universal File Formats for Modal Analysis Testing\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\nUniversal File (UF) formats were originally developed by the Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) in the late 1960s and early 1970s to facilitate data transfer between computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided test (CAT) in order to facilitate computer aided engineering (CAE). SDRC, as part of EDS, continues to support and utilize the UF formats as part of their CAE software. Currently, MTS, Noise and Vibration Division supports and continues to develop IDEAS`software in the test area that utilizes UF formats.\n\nThe formats were originally developed as 80 character (card image), ASCII records that occur in a specific order according to each UF format. As computer files became routinely available, single UF formats were concatentated into computer file structures. Recently, a hybrid UF file structure (UF Dataset 58 Binary) was developed for experimental data that allows data to be stored in a more efficient binary format.\n\nThe use of the Universal File Format as a defacto \"standard\" has been of great value to the experimental dynamics (vibration and acoustic) community, particularly in the area of modal analysis. Both users and vendors have benefited from this defacto standard.\n\nAt this point, many of the UF formats are considered obsolete by the original developer (SDRC) even though these formats are still being used by the experimental community. The UC-SDRL uses the following selected UF formats in research software such as X-Modal and X-ACQuisition.\n\nSelected Current Universal File Structures:\n\nThe specific ASCII structure of several existing Universal File Formats used for experimental data and/or results are:\n\nSearch:\nFileName\tView\n15.asc\t\nView File\n\n18.asc\t\nView File\n\n55.asc\t\nView File\n\n58.asc\t\nView File\n\n58b.asc\t\nView File\n\n82.asc\t\nView File\n\n151.asc\t\nView File\n\n164.asc\t\nView File\n\n259.asc\t\nView File\n\n781.asc\t\nView File\n\n1858.asc\t\nView File\n\n2411.asc\t\nView File\n\n2414.asc\t\nView File\nShowing 1 to 13 of 13 entries\n\n\n\nClick here for list of Complete UFF library"

Payment of the Distribution/Maintenance Fee will be arranged at that time. The annual period of the Distribution/Maintenance Fee will begin when the software is received by the user.\n\nUC-SDRL RESEARCH SOFTWARE is restricted for use on specific computer equipment owned by the Licensee. The number of computers is defined by the type of License (Single in this case). The Licensee agrees to provide information about the organization and the computer(s) that will be utilized.\n\nThe required information will be collected via a single Microsoft Excel formatted file provided to the Licensee once the License is accepted. Once the information is provided via the Excel file and returned by the Licensee, a license activation (security) file will be provided that will allow the Licensee to run the software.

The information will also be used as necessary to contact and interact with the users. At any time during the Term, the Licensee can update the file to change the information as needed.\n\nThe MAC address can be retrieved using the 'ipconfig' or ipconfig /all' command from the Command Prompt window also. The MAC Address of hard wired Ethernet connection (12 digit hex number returned by the “ipconfig /all” command in a Command Prompt window is what we use to lock the software to a specific computer. You need the physical address for the ‘Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection’, i.e. xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx)\n"

The current software that is included in this license agreement is referred to as UC-SDRL Research Software. UC-SDRL Research Software currently includes the X-Modal III modal parameter estimation package with embedded data acquisition module. Data acquisition is currently only supported on specific hardware. This software is described on the following web pages. The UC-SDRL Structural Dynamics Research Consortium is available to organizations that wish to participate in the continuing development of research software focused on structural dynamics. If you wish more information, please contact us.\n\nSUBMIT PAYMENT LICENSE AGREEMENT\nDistribution/Maintenance Fee\n\nWhile there is no initial or continuing cost for the license to use UC-SDRL Research Software, in order to receive the software there is a Distribution/Maintenance Fee that covers the initial distribution and software updates for a one year period. After that time, if the user does not wish to continue receiving updates, no further fee is required. With the release of X-Modal III, the software is now distributed in an executable form with an embedded Matlab engine.\n\nThe user is no longer required to have a specific version of Matlab in order to be able to run the code. If the user has familiarity with Matlab, data can be exported to a number of data formats including several Matlab file formats. Complete software in source script form is no longer available except to Consortium or Enterprise members. The X-Modal software is developed in Matlab script and has historically been available to users in this open text mode. In this mode, still available to Consortium and Enterprise members, a user can potentially maintain the software. The reality is that most users did not attempt to maintain their own software. Many users did not want the open source capability in large industrial situations due to concerns about code verification, validation and certification.\n\nThe Distribution/Maintenance Fee is used to provide maintenance (bug fixes, Matlab version upgrades, operating SW and HW upgrades, etc.), along with new features, by funding graduate research assistants working on their MS or PhD academic programs. The current Distribution/Maintenance Fee structure is: \n\nSingle User ($1250/year)\nMultiple User-Up to 16 seats ($3750/year)\nEducational User-32 seats per lab per educational site ($1250)\nEnterprise User License\nTrial Version of the Software\n\nWith the change of the software to an executable version, 45 day trial copies of the software are available. Trial licenses are made available as a courtesy and subject to changes in policy, etc. Please contact us if you have interest in a trial copy. Naturally, the software can be demonstrated if you are able to visit the University but this is not possible for many users.\n\nFuture Distribution/Maintenance Fees\n\nOnce you have signed the UC-SDRL Research Software License and an initial Distribution/Maintenance Fee has been paid, there is no obligation to continue to pay annual Distribution/Maintenance Fees unless support is required beyond the initial one year period. Examples of support that will be required includes a change in the hardware where the software is executed or the need for new features provided in an upgrade of the software. If such support is needed in the future, only the annual Distribution/Maintenance Fee is required (no back fees to cover the intervening period are required). Nevertheless, if a user wants to support continuing development and maintenance, payment of an annual Distribution/Maintenance Fee is appreciated.\n\nResearch Software License\n\nThe license to use UC-SDRL Research Software is a general agreement not to distribute or commercialize the software but does not limit commercial use in any other way. Single User, Multiple, Educational and Enterprise versions of the license are available. All other licenses require a signed license by both parties."

The Department of Mechanical Engineering originally developed a mobile vibrations laboratory as part of an Air Force contract (1965) to study the structural dynamics of machine tools. That mobile laboratory was equipped with state-of-the-art analog vibration analysis equipment, hydraulic and electrodynamic exciter systems (in order to provide external excitation of the structures), and a variety of transducers, cables, and other equipment necessary to conduct a complete survey of the structural dynamics of machine tools. At that time, this mobile laboratory was the only facility of this type in the world.\n\nThis early work concentrated on the measurement of the vibratory response of a structure due to a single sinusoidal force excitation in order to develop empirical estimates of the frequency response functions of the structure. One goal of such measurements was the solution of vibration problems, in military and commercial applications, in which structural dynamics affect the dynamic performance of the structural system. Another goal was the development of modeling techniques based upon modal representations of the structural characteristics. As a result of the knowledge learned from the Air Force contract, two small companies were formed to provide technical services to industry based upon the knowledge gained from the research at the University. Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) and Zonic Corporation remain today as leaders in this field.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Air Force contract, the UC-SDRL activity continued related vibration research activity at the University. The mobile laboratory was used for University educational purposes, for industrial consulting, and for on-site training in industrial settings. As a result of the Air Force machinability work, many problems had been solved but many questions had been uncovered which would become the focus of research which continues to the present time. Additionally, the results of the application of experimental structural analysis methods to the machine tool area fostered far wider applications in the analysis of vibration, controls, and acoustic considerations in all areas involving structural systems. Applications of this technology to industrial problems led to exciting, new developments at the University including significant developments in the area of digital signal processing, applied Fourier analysis, vibrations, and structural dynamics. In this context, the members of the UC-SDRL developed expertise in the use of electronic compter-based instrumentation for the solution and evaluation of dynamics problems.\n\nThe increased involvment of computers and semiconductor electronics in the experimental analysis equipment started a second phase in the development of the capability of the UC-SDRL. The expertise in experimental analysis of structural dynamics and the capability of the computer based equipment led to new problems and new approaches in the area of experimental analysis of structural dynamics. Based upon this background, the UC-SDRL activity focussed a large effort in the area of modal parameter estimation algorithms. In the early 1970s, all of the initial experimental analysis of structural dynamics were based upon single degree of freedom algorithms which were severely limited in the analysis of frequency response functions acquired from common structural systems. The development of new multiple degree of freedom algorithms that used redundant characteristics in the frequency response function matrix was pioneered in a joint effort by members of the UC-SDRL activity and a similar group at the University of Leuven (Belgium). This joint working relationship continues, and has been expanded to several other universities in the United States, England, France, Japan, and China, in many areas of experimental analysis of structural dynamics.\n\nThe computer-based experimental analysis system provides great flexibility in the algorithms that are available for modal parameter estimation as well as in the presentation and storage of voluminous data in an accurate digital format. The computer-based systems also made possible the real time animation of modal vectors, developed by the UC-SDRL activity for the automotive industry, to provide a capability to interpret the physical meaning of the modal vector. Hardware and software, developed by the UC-SDRL activity, to improve frequency response function estimation, modal parameter estimation, and modal vector animation is now the basis for many commercially available experimental structural dynamics analysis systems. In 1978, the UC-SDRL activity first offered an intensive short course in the area of experimental modal analysis to provide an educational service to industry and to provide funding for the support of research and research personnel. This intensive short course has been given two to four times each year and has served as the basic education in this area for over 700 engineers. The funding generated from this educational activity together with generous corporate grants from Hewlett Packard have enabled the UC-SDRL activity to continue to maintain a lead position in terms of state-of-the-art equipment and ongoing research in the area of experimental analysis of the dynamics of structural systems.\n\nAn outline of some of the significant contributions made by the UC-SDRL activity, a short summary of the funded research that has been part of the UC-SDRL activity since 1975, and a partial list of publications generated by the UC-SDRL activity over the past years are listed in other UC-SDRL WWW pages."

These contaminants can be toxic and may cause health problems in humans and animals. In order to monitor and decompose these contaminants, Dr. Dion’s group is developing nanobiosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity to specific cyanobacterial toxins such as microcystin-LR, -LA, -YR, and -RR. In 2013, his group and collaborators developed a carbon nanotube-based electrochemical biosensor that can detect microcystin-LR (MC-LR) below the World Health Organization’s provisional concentration limit of 1 μg/L. Currently, different biosensors are in development to determine other cyanobacterial toxins. The group has also developed nanotechnology using titanium dioxide (TiO2) that is activated by light. The technology can help to decompose cyanotoxins, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. \n\n\n \n\nPurifying wastewater with a novel bimetallic particle\n\nBimetallic particles, or the fusion of two metals into one, have become popular in the treatment of wastewater and groundwater. Yet current particles, such as zero-valent iron (ZVI), do not perform well in neutral pH conditions and the alternatives are often costly. In this project, visiting professor Dr. Fenglian Fu and colleagues are developing a novel, low-cost bimetallic particle made of a core metal (aluminum) and a second metal (iron). They are using this particle to remove Cr(VI) from wastewater in a wide range of pH conditions. Their tests so far have shown that the Fe/Al bimetal has been effective in treating wastewater in varying pH levels, indicating that this particle could meet the demands for rapid and stable Cr(VI) removal in wastewater treatment.\n\n\nRemoving humic acids from drinking water\n\nHumic acids (HA) can make drinking water discolored, and give it an undesirable taste and odor when they react with the chlorine in water during the drinking water treatment process. This reaction can also produce potential carcinogens such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Dr. Dionysiou and his colleagues are attempting to remove HAs from drinking water by using adsorption, which is considered the major cause of pollutant deactivation. The removal of the acids is important to both inhibit their toxic properties and restricting their transport in water systems.\n\nHis team is using an adsorbent with a high adsorption capacity that can recover easily, making it more practical than other adsorbents to use in the near future.   In particular, they are developing adsorbents with positively charged groups that can efficiently remove HAs. In a detailed study, the group monitored the interaction of HAs with the positively charged adsorbents using adsorption tests and surface characterization techniques.\n\nTreating contaminants in water using oxidation\n\nThe hygiene products we use every day, like shampoo, perfume, and sunscreen, have become one of the biggest contaminants in water today. Because these products are used daily, and also can be resistant to traditional water treatment technology, they carry a huge risk to the health of our bodies and our environment. \n\nDr. Dionysiou and his team are exploring new means for removing these contaminants with Advanced Oxidation Processes, or AOPs. AOPs are fast, environmentally friendly, and they produce fewer by-products. Currently, his team is using the UV-254nm/H2O2 AOP to destroy an organic UV filter, one that is widely used, persistent in the environment, and can be disruptive to the endocrine system. During this process, reactive oxygen species initiate the destructive process of a water pollutant using hydrogen abstraction, electron transfer and other mechanisms. His team is also studying the behavior of the contaminants during the treatment process by exploring transformation products and reaction pathways.\n\nResearch Group & Activities\nExpand AllCollapse All\nIdentifying potential beneficial application of flue gas desulfurization gypsum \nMultiscale and Multitemporal Models to Simulate Absorption and Transport of Multiple Chemical Compounds in Skin Tissues \nDeveloping an instrument for measuring aerosols \nA bio-oil wastewater sustainable treatment technology: Organic acids generation from bio-oil wastewater \nEffects of chemical oxidation on various Cyanobacteria at Differing Life Cycle Stages in Drinking Water Treatment \nDecomposition of Contaminants of Emerging Concern by UV-assisted Advanced Oxidation Process \nQuantification of Carbon Nanotubes through a Microwave Induced Heating Method \nHuman and Ecological Health Impacts Associated with Water Reuse: Engineered Systems for Removing Priority Emerging Contaminants \nDegradation of Emerging Contaminants by Sulfate Radical-based Advanced Oxidation Process \nImplication of Nanomaterials in consumer products \nOptimizing Culturing of Toxin-producing Cyanobacteria. \nFerrite Composite as a Photocatalyst for Removing Cyanotoxins \nPurifying wastewater with a novel bimetallic particle \nJar Testing for Strontium Removal \nTesting Drinking Water with Microelectrodes "

Consumer products such as the Adidas sneakers to biomedical implants, precision electronics of nanoscale to large aircraft components (BAAM) are built using additive manufacturing. Apart from the select few who are actively involved in research and development of various AM processes, the core knowledge surrounding this process and its various characteristics are not commonly available for students. With Industry 4.0 and digital manufacturing gaining significant traction in today’s world, it is imperative for educational institutions to recognize the importance of incorporating AM in the course curriculum.\n\nAs a step forward, the University of Cincinnati has developed several additive manufacturing software modules within Siemens NX. Educating students about AM specific part design guidelines pertaining to support structures during the design phase of the part is the objective and motivation behind this effort. Before we dive into the details of the module, let us clear one simple concept – What is a support structure?\n\nA support structure or more commonly supports are structures built along with the part to aid in the manufacturing of features that do not have any material underneath it. Such features can be called as overhang features which may fall down or collapse due to gravity in the absence of support structures during the build process. After the manufacture of the part, these support structures are removed from the actual part.\n\nNow, the next question that may come up in the mind of a reader is why are they so important that we need to make software modules to analyze and build them? The answer to this question is three-fold. Ironically, support structures not only play an important role in the manufacturing of overhang features, they adversely affect the overall quality and surface finish of the end product. The process of removing the support structures causes poor surface finish of the part where the support structures come into contact with the part surface. The second reason is the requirement of material to build the support structures which then goes to waste when they are removed. Finally, additional post-processing efforts are required at the end of the build to remove the support structures using various machining processes or manual methods. Due to these reasons, the analysis and optimal placement of support structures during the design phase of the part is an important skill-set to possess for all manufacturing engineering students as well as industry personnel.\n\nIn this case study, the software modules created within Siemens NX to visualize, build, and analyze the removability of support structures are discussed with the help of part shown in Figure 1. \n\nSupport Visualization and Parameter Calculation Module\n\nThe objective of this software module is to provide the designer with quick feedback on the location of support structures along with numerical output on parameters such as support structure volume, support contact area, build height, and the area of the down-facing surfaces that do not require support structures. For fast processing and calculation of the said parameters, the support structures are represented by line curves. The outcome of this module is the ability to expedite the downstream optimization processes which involve design updates and rotation of the part in different orientations to check the optimal build setup. Figure 2 shows the output of the support visualization tool.\n\nFigure 2: GUI and Output Window of the Support Visualization Tool in Siemens NX\n\nSupport Structure Generation Module\n\nAs mentioned earlier, support structures are required to build overhanging features in the part model. In this software module, as shown in figure 3, support structures are created as CAD objects which are integrated with the part model to form one single part file. This part file can be converted to the STL file format which then gets transformed into CLI/SLI files that are readable by an AM machine. The main outcome of this module is the multiple options provided to the designer to create different support structure types such as solid, hollow, surface, and supports with honeycomb cross-sections. This module also gives the designer the ability to make different types of support structures within the same part based on the load requirement of the actual part. Due to the creation of actual CAD bodies for each support column, this module takes more time than the support structure visualization tool.\n\nFigure 3: GUI and Output Window of the Support Generation Tool in Siemens NX\n\nAccessibility and Setup Analysis Module\n\nSupport structures need to be removed from the actual part after the build. Depending on the type of AM process, support structures are removed using an EDM tool or manually. In this process of removal of support structures, the most important concern is time. To reduce the overall time taken to build a finished part, it is important to reduce the number of machining tool setups required to remove all the support structures. This module is aimed at providing the designer an ability to foresee the down-stream post-processing efforts. An optimized tooling setup sequence is provided to remove maximum possible support structures based on the orientation of build. Figure 4 shows the output of the accessibility and setup analysis for the same orientation used to create support structures in the design example used for the first two modules.\n\nFigure 4: GUI and Output Window of the Accessibility and Setup Analysis Tool in Siemens NX\n\nThe software modules created within Siemens NX serves a key tool to educate students and industry personnel about support structures required for Additive Manufacturing.\n\nThe collaboration of the University of Cincinnati with Siemens PLM Software has facilitated the development of these software modules. It is our hope that these tools will serve as a key element in educating undergraduate students to achieve the necessary skill-set to ace in this ever-developing Additive Manufacturing environment."

The tool can highlight critical thin wall features in the geometry that may be fused during the laser sintering process and depends on laser diameter or nozzle diameter.\n\nInstructions\n\nFigure 1 Producibility Index GUI Support\n\nThe Producibility Index GUI is shown in the figure below. The detailed explanation of each option in the GUI is given below.\n\na) Select Body\nThis option is used to select the body for which thin walls are detected and highlighted.\n\nb) X Candidate Orientations\nNumber of rotation angle in X direction. (e.g. input as ‘3’, 00 ,1200  ,2400 will be checked)\n\nc) Y Candidate Orientations\nNumber of rotation angle in Y direction. (e.g. input as ‘3’, 00 ,1200  ,2400 will be checked)\n\nd) Support Type\nSolid Support: Each support column generated will be solid.\nHollow Support: Each support column is hollow (thickness can be entered in option \nSurface Support: Support columns are surfaces with no thickness. The minimum thickness for support structures will be the laser diameter used to sinter the material powder using DMLS.\nHoneycomb Support: This type of support structures columns is connected with each other. During post-processing operations for support structure removal interconnected support structures are less prone to chip off and damage critical features of the part.\n\ne) Threshold Angle\nThe angle between the part surface normal and the build direction (Z axis) is entered here. The default value is set to 135 degrees.\n\nf) Support Column Length\nSupport Column length is the center-to-center distance between two adjacent support columns (square cross-section). It is also the side length of the cross section of the support column (square cross-section). Values ranging from 1.00 to 4.00 are optimal. A lower value will take longer computational time due to more number of support structures. A higher value of overhang length will generate fewer support structures making the solution sub-optimal.\n\ng) Gap Between Supports\nThis is the side-to-side gap between two adjacent support columns. The Gap Between Supports should always be less than the Support Column Length\n\nh) Hollow Thickness\nThis value provides thickness to hollow support structures.\n\nFigure 2 Producibility Index GUI DFAM\n\ni) Add Teeth\nCheck this box if you want to create support structures with a tooth at the support to part contact region. Removal of support structures with teeth is easy and will not damage the parts during post-processing. The contact area of support structures will be less if this option is selected. Teeth length is the side dimension of the top side of the teeth (as shaded by red in the figure). A value of zero teeth length means the support contact region is a point. Thus, the support contact area calculated will be 0 mm^2. \n\nj) Small Opening Length\nThe threshold length of the gap that is identified as a small opening is entered here. (unit in mm).\n\nk) Thin Region Length\nThreshold thickness of the region that is identified as thin region is entered here.

Thin to thick transitions are transition areas from a low area layer to a high area layer along the build direction. In the DMLS process, the laser melts the metal powders and fuses them together. The heat energy in the current layer is transferred to the substrate through the layers beneath it. If the transition area between any consecutive layers is too small, it may cause thermal distortion due to impediments to heat transfer during DMLS process.\n\nFigure 1 Custom GUI and result output for thin thick transition in Siemens NX Modeling\n\nInstructions\n\nFigure 2 Thin to Thick Transition GUI\n\nThe Thin to Thick Transition GUI is shown in the figure below.

This tool slices the body into several layers based on the specified layer thickness. The laser path in each layer is traced and the total sintering area and the sintering time across all the layers is computed. The user can specify different build direction, slice thickness, laser parameters (diameter, speed, overlap) and hatch pattern to perform analysis and identify the build parameters which result in minimum build time for a given part.\n\nInstallation Manual\n\n1. Download and extract the contents of the .zip file named Build Time.zip.\n\n2. Open the extracted folder named Build Time.\n\n3. Open the folder named ug_customization. Right click on the Windows Batch File named nx and open with Notepad/Notepad++.\n\n4. Find the current file path of the nx file in your computer (Right click >> Properties). Copy the file path and paste it in the first line (the highlighted portion in the notepad as shown below).\n\nFigure 1\n\n5. Change the version of Siemens NX to the one you are using (module works for Siemens NX 10.0, 11.0, and 12.0) in the third line of the notepad file (as highlighted below).\n\nFigure 2\n\nOnce these steps are carried out, you have completed the installation procedures before launching the application.\n\n6. Now, double-click nx to launch the Windows Batch File. This will launch the Siemens NX window and a terminal window (you can minimize it or close it – it contains the information you input in steps 4 and 5). You may notice the UC AM Modules tab in the top toolbar. Click on it. The Build Time module will be visible.\n\n7. Before using the module, user is supposed to import/create a Parasolid File of a part within Siemens NX. For illustration purposes, the Part File (. prt) and Parasolid File (.x_t) is given in the folder named Example Parts. Import the Parasolid file into Siemens NX. Follow the step mentioned below to import a Parasolid file of the part.\nOpen >> (Choose the file location of Build Time Folder) >>\nExample Parts >> Part_1.x_t >> Ok\n\n8. Once the file is opened in Siemens NX, you can click on Build Time button on the Command Ribbon. The button will look like this >>\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n9. The Build Time GUI is shown in the adjacent figure. The detailed explanation of each option in the GUI is given below.\n\n\na. Select Body\nThis option is used to select the body for which support structures need to be visualized.\n\nb. Specify Build Direction\nThe direction of build (manufacture) is specified which the help of a vector.\n\nc. Slice thickness\nThe body is sliced in to layers based on the specified slice thickness.\n\nd. Laser Diameter\nTo calculate the path traced by the laser on every layer the laser diameter is used.\n\ne. Laser Speed\nThe Laser Speed affects the sintering time of the laser across all the layers.\n\nf. Laser Overlap\nThe actual displacement of the laser in each traversal is calculated based on the laser  Overlap\n\ng. Change Overtime for each layer\nThe total Change Overtime is the product of number of layers with the Change Overtime for each layer.\n\nh. Hatch Angle\nThe path traced by the laser on each layer is determined by the hatch angle, the angle made by the laser with the +X axis\n\n10. The output window of the Build Time module is shown below. The results consist of number of layers in which the part is built, total laser path distance, the sintering time and total time taken to build the part. The path traced by the laser is highlighted in green points on the contour of every slice.\n\n\nPlease watch the video tutorial of the module conducted on an example part given with the module.\n\nFigure 4\n\nContour points (green) traced by laser in each layer \n\n\nOutput from the GUI\n\nExample Problem\n\nUse the Parasolid File named Part_1.x_t in the Example Parts folder attached in the Build Time module folder that you have extracted from the website.\n\nTry out the following input configurations to note the changes in number of layers, total laser path, sintering time and the total time taken to build the part.\n\nSpecify the build orientation as + Z axis.

For \n\nInstructions\n\nThe Accessibility Tool GUI is shown in the figure below. The detailed explanation of each option in the GUI is given below. \n\nFigure 1 Support Accessibility Detection GUI\n\na) Orientation Independent Directions\nThe direction of the tool is independent of the build orientation.\n\n6 Cartesian Directions for the tool which are +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, and -Z directions and 8 Cartesian Diagonal Directions for the tool are ±X, ±Y, and ±Z – 8 combinations.\n\nb) Orientation Dependent Directions\nThe direction of the tool changes as the build orientation changes. The directions are selected as vectors. For selection of directions, click on Add New set and select the vectors using the options available in NX.\n\nc) Select Body\n\nSelect the body for which accessibility has to be visualized and analyzed.\n\nd) Rotation\nInput rotation of the part along X and Y axes\n\ne) Threshold angle\nThe angle between the part surface normal and the build direction (Z axis) is entered here. The default value is set to 135 degrees.\n\nf) Overhang Length\nOverhang length is the center-to-center distance between two adjacent support columns (square cross-section). It is also the side length of the cross section of the support column (square cross-section). Values ranging from 1.00 to 4.00 are optimal. A lower value will take longer computational time due to a greater number of support structures. A higher value of overhang length will generate fewer support structures making the solution sub-optimal.\n\nAfter making the selections for the input parameters in the Accessibility tool GUI, the module requires the user to click the OK button after the accessibility analysis, to go to the next set up (this number depends on the number of tooling sequence), to display in-accessible points, and finally to end the sequential display.\nThe output window of the Accessibility module is shown below. The results consist of accessibility index (percentage of supports that can be removed), total points considered and the tooling sequence. \n\nInterpretation of tooling sequence: The tool sequence shows the optimal sequence of directions to remove all the accessible supports. For example, in the output shows below, the optimal sequence would be first removing the support from direction of vector 3 (which can remove 96.15% of supports), and then removing the remaining support from direction of vector 1 (which can remove 0.464% of supports). The vectors are displayed in the CAD geometry and removable supports are shown in different colors with respect to each sequence.\n\nFigure 2 Support Accessibility Output Window\n\nPlease watch the video tutorial of the module for an example part included with the zip file of the module.\n\nExample Problem\n\nUse the Parasolid File named Support_Accessibility_Eg_1.x_t in the Example Parts folder attached in the Accessibility Tool folder that you have extracted from the website. Try out the following input configurations to note the changes in Orientation Independent Directions, Orientation Dependent Directions, and Rotation\n\nFigure 3 Support Accessibility Example Problem\n\na. Select 6 Cartesian Directions in Orientation Independent Directions, Rotate the part along X axis by 35 degrees and rotate the part along Y axis by 50 degrees Set Threshold to default value (135 degrees).  Input Overhang Length as 4.00 mm.\n\nb. Select 8 Cartesian Directions in Orientation Independent Directions, Rotate the part along X axis by 45 degrees and rotate the part along Y axis by 0 degrees Set Threshold to default value (135 degrees).  Input Overhang Length as 4.00 mm.\n\nc. Select three orthogonal directions along the edges of the cubic body at the origin in Orientation Dependent Directions, Rotate the part along X axis by 0 degrees and rotate the part along Y axis by 0 degrees Set Threshold to default value (135 degrees).  Input Overhang Length as 4.00 mm.

The cusp error has an effect on the surface finish of the manufactured part. This tool calculates the cusp error with respect to every facet of the CAD body and the average cusp error for the entire part build. All the facets satisfying the specified threshold cusp height are highlighted in green and the rest are highlighted in red specifying out of spec areas. The user can specify different input parameters such as orientation of the part, layer thickness and threshold cusp height and perform analysis to determine the suitable build parameters for good surface finish.\n\nInstallation Manual\n\n1.

Select Body\nThis option is used to select the body for which support structures need to be generated.\n\nb. Rotation along X axis\nRotation along X axis (value to be entered in degrees) will rotate the selected part along the X axis.\n\nc. Rotation along Y axis\nRotation along Y axis (value to be entered in degrees) will rotate the selected part along the Y axis.\n\nd. Threshold\nIt is the angle between the part surface normal and the build direction (Z axis). The default value is set to 135 degrees.\n\ne. Support Type\n\nSolid Support: Each support column generated will be solid.\n\nHollow Support: Each support column is hollow (thickness can be entered in option h)\n\nSurface Support: Support columns are surfaces with no thickness. The minimum thickness for support structures will be the laser diameter used to sinter the material powder using DMLS.\n\nHoneycomb Support: This type of support structures columns is connected with each other.

This tool provides quick feedback on support structures as well as calculates parameters such as support volume, support contact area, build height, and down-facing areas (areas that do not need support structures). Because this module is developed to visualize the support structures for a particular orientation, the support structures are represented as lines for faster calculations.\n\nModelling of Solid, Hollow and Honeycomb Supports\n\nSupport Generation module is used to generate support structures needed to build the part for a user-input build orientation. Different types of support structures can be generated using this module, details of which will be explained in the instruction manual.\n\nCalculation of Cusp Error\n\nCusp Error is a measure used to quantify the deviation between the designed and manufactured part. The cusp error has an effect on the surface finish of the manufactured part. This tool calculates the cusp error with respect to every facet of the CAD body and the average cusp error for the entire part build. All the facets satisfying the specified threshold cusp height are highlighted in green and the rest are highlighted in red specifying out of spec areas. The user can specify different input parameters such as orientation of the part, layer thickness and threshold cusp height and perform analysis to determine the suitable build parameters for good surface finish.\n\nCalculation of Build Time\n\nBuild Time is the sum of the times taken by the laser to sinter each layer and the change over time between successive layers. This tool slices the body into several layers based on the specified layer thickness. The laser path in each layer is traced and the total sintering area and the sintering time across all the layers is computed. The user can specify different build direction, slice thickness, laser parameters (diameter, speed, overlap) and hatch pattern to perform analysis and identify the build parameters which result in minimum build time for a given part.\n\nSupport Accessibility Tool\n\nSupport Accessibility module is used to visualize and generate the tooling/machining sequence required to remove support structures built for a part using user-input build orientation. For \n\nRecoater Arm Collision Detection Tool\n\nRecoater Arm Collision Detection Tool is used to detect and highlight the potential deformation areas or sharp edges of the parts that may collide with the recoater arm and damage the part and/or recoater. Recoater arm spread the powder from one side of the build platform to the other. If there is a long-edge parallel to the recoater, it will be more difficult for the recoater to pass over it in case of deformation. This tool can rotate a part and specify the recoater direction and identify areas of the part that may be prone to recoater damage.\n\nSharp Corner Detection Tool\n\nSharp Corner Detection Tool is used to detect and highlight sharp corners in the geometry that are difficult to manufacture in powder bed AM process. Sharp corners are tips within each layer where the angle of the tip is less than threshold value of the AM machine. If the angle is too small, these sharp corners in the geometry may be difficult to manufacture during the laser sintering process. This tool can rotate a part and highlights critical sharp corners in the geometry and calculate the number of the sharp corners in each layer.\n\nSmall Opening Detection Tool\n\nSmall Opening Detection module is used to detect and highlight small holes and gaps in the geometry that are difficult to manufacture in AM Process. The tool can Highlight critical small opening features in the geometry that may be fused during the laser sintering process. Depends on laser diameter or nozzle diameter. This tool can rotate a part and highlight critical small opening features in the geometry and calculate the areas of the small openings in each layer    \n\nThin Feature Detection Tool\n\nThin Feature Detection module is used to detect and highlight thin features in the geometry that are difficult to manufacture in AM Process. Thin features are prone to increased thermal deformations due to build up of residual stresses. The thin feature dimensions depend on laser diameter or nozzle diameter. This tool can rotate a part and highlight critical thin sections in the geometry and calculate the areas of thin section region in each layer.\n\nThin to Thick Transition Detection Tool\n\nThin to Thick Transition Detection module is used to detect and highlight thin to thick transition areas in the geometry that could cause high thermal distortion in AM Process. Thin to thick transitions are transition areas from a low area layer to a high area layer along the build direction. In the DMLS process, the laser melts the metal powders and fuses them together. The heat energy in the current layer is transferred to the substrate through the layers beneath it. If the transition area between any consecutive layers is too small, it may cause thermal distortion due to impediments to heat transfer during DMLS process.\n\nThin Walls Detection Tool\n\nThin Walls Detection module is used to detect and highlight thin walls in the geometry that are difficult to manufacture in AM Process. Thin wall is vertical wall structure where the thickness of the wall is too small. Thin walls are very challenge to manufacture duo to the laser spot diameter or FDM nozzle size. Moreover, thin walls could lead to failure or high thermal distortion due to the thermal stress within the thin wall region.\n\nProducibility Index\n\nProducibility Index module is used to detect and highlight small holes and gaps in the geometry that are difficult to manufacture in AM Process. The tool can highlight critical thin wall features in the geometry that may be fused during the laser sintering process and depends on laser diameter or nozzle diameter."

A GUI for simulating this curve is developed within NX using C++ and Ufuncs. This tool is used in the course for demonstrating the impact of change in parameters on the shape of hermite curve. Students are assigned problems to create Hermite curves with various parameters and this tool helps them in visualizing and validating their work. \n\nDesign & Analysis of Hermite Surfaces\n\nBicubic Hermite Surface is an extension of Hermite Curve. The Hermite Surface is defined by 16 parameters (4 end points, 8 tangent vectors at end points, 4 twist vectors). It is challenging for students to understand the changes in surface as the change in parameters. This is a GUI which simulates the behavior of this surface is created within NX using NX API, C++ and Ufuncs. This enables students to interact with GUI by providing various surface parameters and visualize their effect on the shape of surface.

In this example, we simulate the flow between heated plain fins. The model consists of an inlet section, plain fin section, and an outlet section. Pressure and temperature are specified at the inlet boundary, and on the other hand, the outlet is set as atmospheric pressure. Temperature of the heated plates is maintained at 350 K.\n\n\nSteps\nBuilding Geometry\nTopology\nMeshing\nPhysics Models and Boundary Conditions\nPreparing Simulation\nPost Processing\n1. Building Geometry\n\nTo begin with, we will need to create the geometry of the flow domain. Right-click on the 3D-CAD Models and select “New” to start building a CAD model.\n\n\nCreate a sketch by right-clicking on the XY plane and select “Create Sketch”.\n\n\nFor our convenience, we will set the grid spacing of the sketch to 10 mm.\n\n\nDraw a rectangle that starts from the origin and right-click to apply the fixation constraint at the sketch origin so that the bottom left corner of the rectangle will be fixed when we give the dimensions later.\n\n\nSimilarly, draw the other 2 rectangles in the right.\n\nApply length dimension to the first rectangle.\n\nUse Ctrl to select the points shown in Figure, and right click to apply coincidence constraint so the width of the second rectangle would be the same as the first one. Apply the same constraint to the third rectangle. \n\n\nApply the length dimension as shown in Figure.\n\nDelete the lines in the middle.\n\nClick \"ok\" to exit sketch mode.\n\nExtrude the sketch with the thickness of 10 mm.\n\n\nThe thickness can be arbitrary since the simulation is only two-dimensional.\n\nOnly the fluid part would be simulated in this example so the solid part can be cut off. To do this, create sketch on the +z face of the extruded body.\n\n\nRight click and project the line to sketch and set it as a construction line. \n\n\nA construction line is only a reference.\n\nDraw a rectangle on the construction line with the length of 90 mm and the width of 2 mm.\n\n\nExtrude the sketch towards the geometry with the distance of 10 mm and set the body interaction to none.\n\n\nRight click on “Body 2” and select “Linear Pattern Cut.”\n\n\nSet the parameters as in the following figures, then the solid parts would be cut out.\n\nDirection: (0,1,0)\n\nDistance: 18 mm\n\nNumber of instances: 6\n\nClose 3D-CAD and go back to the main panel.\n\n\nRename the body that was created in the 3D-CAD to “Fluid”. \n\n2. Topology\n\nWe will need to prepare a topology for simulation. The flow domain and the boundary faces would be determined in this step. Right-click on the Fluid and select “New Geometry part” and click ok by agreeing to use the default settings.\n\n\nCreate a geometry scene from the toolbar.\n\n\nRename “Body1” to “Fluid” and expand the “Surfaces” under the fluid. Right-click on “Default” and select “Split by Patch”. Be sure you have created the geometry scene before you execute this command.\n\n\nName each boundary by selecting the surface from the numbers or from the geometry. \n\n\nSet the surface that lies on the xy-plane as “Domain”.\n\nRight-click on “Fluid” in “Parts” and select “Badge for 2D Meshing” and click ok. \n\n\nRight-click on “Badge for 2D Meshing” and select “Execute”. The flow domain will now be converted to 2D.\n\n\nThe solid icon under the “Surfaces” represents the flow domain and the empty icon represents the boundary. The “Default” surface will not be used in the future simulation.\n\nAssigned parts to regions and make a change on the boundary option. \n\n\nA “Region” would be created under “Region” folder. Rename the “Region” under to “Fluid”. \n\n3. Meshing\n\nBefore simulation, we have to discretize the calculation domain, which also called meshing. We can do it by creating the mesh from “Fluid” under “Parts”. Use “Automated mesh” instead of “Automated mesh (2D)”.\n\n\nSelect “Surface Remesher” and “Trimmed Cell Mesher” as the meshing models.\n\n\n“Automated Mesh” will be created under “Operations”. Change the base size to 1 mm.\n\n\nClick on the icon in the toolbar to generate the mesh.\n\n\nCreate a mesh scene to check on the mesh in the window.\n\n\nThe final mesh will show in the mesh scene.\n\n\n4. Physics Models and Boundary Conditions\n\nNow we have to decide the physics models for the simulation and set the boundary conditions as well. \n\nTo enable the required physics models, double click on “Models” under “Continua” and select the following models in the order of:\n\nTwo dimensional\nSteady\nGas\nSegregated flow\nConstant density\nLaminar\nSegregated fluid temperature\n\nAfter finishing the selection of physics models, we will set the boundary conditions face by face. The default settings of all the boundaries would be wall, so we have to change them accordingly. The boundary condition of the heated plain fins is wall with constant temperature. Since the boundary of “Fluid.Fins” is already wall, we will expand the “physics conditions” and change the thermal specification to “Temperature”.\n\n\nSet the static temperature under “Physics Values” to 350 K. Now, the boundary condition of the plain fins has been specified.\n\n\nWe will then set the inlet boundary condition. Go to “Fluid.Inlet” and change the type of the boundary to pressure outlet and set the value of pressure to 0.2 Pa.\n\n\nSet the backflow specification to “static” to keep the inlet pressure as we set earlier.\n\n\nThe walls of inlet and outlet section are considered as adiabatic walls so that there will be no heat exchange at these surfaces. To achieve this, go to “Fluid.Wall” and make sure the type of boundary is wall.\n\nThe boundary condition of “Fluid.Outlet” is pressure outlet. Change the type of the boundary, and leave the value of pressure as default, which is 0 Pa. It is noteworthy that the pressure is the gauge pressure.\n\n5. Preparing Simulation\n\nIn this step, we will set up the scenes and monitors. This will allow us to check the results while running. To visualize the temperature contour, create a scalar scene from the tool bar.\n\n\nIn the scalar scene, right-click on the legend and select temperature function.\n\n\nIn order to show the mean temperature at the outlet, use “mass flow averaged” in “Reports”. Choose the temperature for the field function and the outlet for parts.\n\n\nRight-click on “Mass Flow Averaged 1” and select “Create Monitor and Plot from Report” to monitor the temperature while calculating.\n\n\nNext, we will have to provide the stopping criteria for the simulation. Set the maximum steps of iterations to 10000 under “Stopping Criteria”.\n\n\nWe can also set the stopping criteria by checking the residuals instead of giving a fixed iteration step alone. Right-click on “Stopping Criteria” and create new criterion from monitor.\n\n\nChoose energy in the list. After that, set the “Logical Rule” to “And” and set the minimum limit for “Energy Criterion” to 1E-8. \n\nRepeat the previous steps and create other three monitors for “Continuity”, “X-momentum”, and “Y-momentum”. Set the “Logical Rule” to “And”. Set the minimum limit for these criteria to 1E-6. \n\n\nFrom the settings in the stopping criteria, the simulation will stop when all of the converging criteria has been satisfied. Before running the simulation, initial values should be given. Check the initial static temperature and make sure it is 300 K. Then select the icon in tool bar and initialize the solution.\n\nClick run to start the calculation.\n\n6. Post Processing\n\nPost processing is rather important because we need to examine the result and further analyze it. After finishing the simulation, check the residual plot and see if all the converging criteria are satisfied.\n\nThe temperature contour would be shown in the scalar scene.\n\nTo include the boundary temperature in the contour, change the contour style to “Smooth Filled”. The range of the legend would become 300 K to 350 K.\n\nDouble click on “Mass Flow Averaged 1” from “Report” then you can get the mean outlet temperature.\n\n\nCreate a new report for mass flow and assigned fluid outlet to “Parts” at the properties window.\n\n\nDouble click on “Mass Flow 1” than you can get the mass flow rate at the outlet.\n\n\nThe total heat transfer rate Q can be determined by the change of enthalpy\n\n\nWhere m is the mass flow rate, Cp is the specific heat, Tout is the outlet temperature, and Tin is the inlet temperature. Nusselt number can then be obtained from the total heat transfer rate Q and the log-mean temperature difference Delta Tlm\n\n\nWhere\n\n\nFor further examination, we can create a line probe and see how the flow temperature varies along the line. The line probe will locate at the vicinity of one of the fin walls. Right-click on “Derived Parts” and create a line from the menu. Set the coordinate of point 1 and point 2 to (0 mm, 54 mm, 0 mm) and (290 mm, 54 mm, 0 mm), respectively. Change the resolution to 50. Select “No Displayer”.\n\n\nRight-click on “Plot” and create a XY plot.\n\n\nLeft-click on “XY Plot 1” and click on “Parts” in the properties. Select “XY Plot 1” under “Derived Parts”. Expand “XY Plot 1” and assign temperature to the scalar function under “Y Types”.\n\n\nChange the maximum and the minimum values of y-axis to 350 K and 300K.\n\n\nThe temperature profile along the wall can be shown in the plot. It should be noted that the values at the fin section are the temperatures in the cells next to the wall.\n\nSimilarly, we can create line probes in between fins.Right-click on “Derived Parts” and create a line from the menu for 3 times.\n\nLine 1: (60 mm, 38 mm, 0 mm) and (60 mm, 54 mm, 0 mm)\n\nLine 2: (95 mm, 38 mm, 0 mm) and (95 mm, 54 mm, 0 mm)\n\nLine 3: (130 mm, 38 mm, 0 mm) and (130 mm, 54 mm, 0 mm)\n\nChange the resolution to 15.\n\nRename the 3 lines to 10 mm, 45 mm and 80 mm at the corresponding location.\n\n\nCreate a new XY Plot and assign the line 10 mm, 45 mm and 80 mm to the parts in the plot properties.\n\n\nChange the “Vector Quantity” of x-axis to (0, 1, 0) and assign x-axis to left axis. Likewise, assign y-axis to bottom axis. Also click on “Smooth Values”.\n\nExpand “Y Types” and select velocity magnitude in the scalar function for velocity profile. Similarly, Select temperature in the scalar function for temperature profile.\n\n\nExpand the line probes and select the line style in the properties to connect all of the data points.\n\n\nThe final velocity profile will show in the plot if the velocity magnitude is selected as the scalar function.\n\n\nThe final temperature profile will show in the plot if the temperature is selected as the scalar function.\n\n\nExample By: Kuan-Ting Lin\n"

Students would be able to build a three-dimensional flow domain and conjugate heat transfer simulation after finishing this example.\n\n1.2 Introduction\n\nOffset-strip fin is one of the most popular enhanced fin cores in the application of compact heat exchanger. The geometrical features are shown in the following figure. Compared to plain plate-fin, the improvement in heat transfer is mainly due to periodic disruption of boundary layers and downstream fluid mixing.\n\nIn this simulation, fin spacing s = 0.002 m, fin thickness t = 0.00015 m, fin height hf = 0.01 m, and offset length l = 0.0032 m. Since only the fully developed condition is considered, the calculation domain consists of two periods of the offset length (2l) within a single channel (s + t), and the periodic boundary condition is applied at the inlet and outlet boundaries. The boundaries in the transverse direction will be considered as symmetry planes. The top and bottom surfaces are considered as no-slip walls with uniform and constant temperature. The flow condition is considered as constant-property, laminar, and steady airflow. The thermophysical properties of air are dynamic viscosity μ =1.87e-5 Pa-s, density ρ = 1.166 kg/m3, specific heat cp = 1005 J/kgK, and thermal conductivity k = 0.0264 W/mK.\n\nThe Reynolds number of the offset-strip fin is defined as:\n\nWhere the hydraulic diameter dh can be expressed as:\n\nIn this simulation, the Reynolds number is set as 600, and from the calculation the corresponding mass flow rate is 6.732e-5 kg/s. Moreover, the material of the fin is aluminum, which has a thermal conductivity of 237 W/mK.\n\n1.3 Steps\nBuilding Geometry / Step 1\nTopology / Step 2\nMeshing / Step 3\nPhysics Models and Boundary Conditions / Step 4\nPreparing Simulation / Step 5\nPost Processing / Step 6\n1.3.1 Building Geometry / Step 1\n\nTo begin with, the geometry of the fluid domain needs to be created. Right-click on the 3D-CAD Models and select “New” to start building a CAD model.\n\nCreate a sketch by right-clicking on the XY plane and select Create Sketch.\n\nFor our convenience, we will set the grid spacing of the sketch to 0.001 m.\n\nDraw a rectangle that starts from the origin. Right-click at the point at the origin to apply the fixation constraint so that the location of the bottom left corner of the rectangle will be fixed.\n\nRight-click on the lines to apply dimensions and set the length and width as in the figure. Click OK to exit the sketch.\n\nRight-click on Sketch1 and extrude for 0.01 m.\n\nRight-click on the top surface and create a sketch on the +z face.\n\nUse the icon in the display option to view the x-y plane in the sketch if the scene has been rotated.\n\nRight-click on the line and project the line to the sketch. Right-click on the line again to set it as a construction line.\n\nDraw a rectangle from the construction line and set the dimensions as in the figure.\n\nSelect the bottom-left point and set the y-coordinate. Then click OK to exit the sketch.\n\nRight-click on Sketch2 and extrude the body into the first block.\n\nExpand Bodies in the tree. Right-click on Body2 and use the linear pattern tool.\n\nSet the distance in the x-direction to 0.0048 m and the number of instances to 2.\n\nRight-click on the top surface again and create another sketch on the +z face.\n\nProject the bottom line on the sketch and set it as construction. Draw a rectangle from the construction line and set the dimensions as in the figure. Set the x-coordinate of the bottom-left point.\n\nRight-click on Sketch3 and extrude.\n\nRight-click on Body4 and use the linear pattern tool. Set the instances of x and y to 1 and 2, respectively. Change the distance in the y-direction to 0.002075 m.\n\nRight-click on Body1 and rename it to Fluid. Rename the other bodies from Fin1 to Fin4 in sequence.\n\nUse Shift to select all the bodies, then right-click and use the subtract in Boolean operation.\n\nFluid is the target body and the other fins are tool bodies. If the bodies are not in the correct boxes, right-click and remove all the components.\n\nClick the Target Bodies box and select Fluid. Click the Tool Bodies box and use Ctrl to select from Fin1 to Fin4. If the fins are blocked by the Fluid, right-click on the top surface and hide it.\n\nAfter finish selecting the bodies, activate the option to keep the tool bodies after the operation. Click Close 3D-CAD to exit the CAD mode.\n\n1.3.2 Topology / Step 2\n\nIn the topology, the flow domain and the boundary faces would be determined in this step. The naming of each boundary face is shown in the figure and would follow the rules as follows:\n\n-x: Inlet\n\n+x: Outlet\n\n-z:  Bottom\n\n+z: Top\n\n-y and +y: Symmetry\n\nRight-click on the 3D-CAD Model 1 and select “New Geometry part”. Use default settings and click OK.\n\nCreate a geometry scene from the toolbar.\n\nExpand Fluid, right-click on Default and select Split by Patch. Be sure you have created the geometry scene before you execute this command.\n\nUse Ctrl to select the two faces at the -x. The selected faces would also be highlighted in the box. Name them as Inlet and click create, and these two faces would disappear. Repeat the process and name the other faces as well.\n\nThe final surfaces of each part would be as in the figure.\n\nCollapse all the parts. Right-click on Fluid and select Assigned Parts to Regions and make changes to the boundary options. A “Region” would be created under the “Region” folder. Rename the “Region” to “Fluid”.\n\nUse Shift to select all the fins. Right-click and select Assigned Parts to Regions and make changes to the boundary options. Another “Region” would be created under the “Region” folder. Rename the new “Region” to “Fins”.\n\nChange the type of Fins in the Region to a solid region.\n\n1.3.3 Meshing / Step 3\n\nA structured directed mesh is used for this simulation. To build the directed mesh, Right-click on Operations and select the directed mesh option. Select all the bodies in the pop-up window.\n\nA new directed mesh is created under operation. Right-click on it and select edit.\n\nThe surfaces for the source mesh and target mesh need to be specified.\n\nFor the source mesh, assign all the bottom surfaces in the bodies to it.\n\nSimilarly, assign all the top surfaces to the target mesh.\n\nRight-click on Source Meshes and select Patch Mesh.\n\nTo have a better view on the xy-plane, use the view from +z direction.\n\nThe lines need to be populated with dots before further editing. Under the Patch Topology mode, use the first icon to auto-populate the edges with dots.\n\nUse the scissor tool to add four additional dots on the lines. Then use ESC to dismiss the scissor function.\n\nThe coordinate of the dot will be shown in the left column after selecting it. To form a structured mesh, the added dots in the lower half will be specified with y = 7.5e-5 m, and the added dots in the upper half will be specified with y = 0.002075 m.\n\nUse the second icon and select two dots to form a straight line in between. Press ESC to dismiss the function and select the icon to form another line between the other two dots.\n\nAfter connecting all the dots, the color of the lines will turn to green.\n\nChange the mode from Patch Topology to Patch Mesh. Selecting the line in the figure will highlight all the lines that will be using the same number of divisions. The number of divisions in each set of lines is shown in the figure.\n\nThe final surface mesh will be constructed after finishing the settings. Then click Close.\n\nRight-click on Mesh Distribution and select New Volume Distribution. Set the number of layers to 100. Select Close Directed Mesh\n\nUse the icon to generate volume mesh.\n\nCreate a mesh scene to check on the mesh in the window.\n\nThe final mesh can be visualized in the mesh scene.\n\nIn this section, physics models for the simulation and the boundary conditions would be determined. Right-click on Continua and create another Physics Continuum. One of the physics continuums is created for Fluid and the other for Fins. Therefore, rename Physics 1 and Physics 2 to Fluid and Fins, respectively.\n\nTo enable the required physics models for Fluid, expand Fluid and double-click on “Models” and select the following models in the order of:\n\nThree dimensional\nSteady\nGas\nSegregated flow\nConstant density\nLaminar\nSegregated fluid temperature\n\nThe thermophysical properties of air can be set in the models, which dynamic viscosity μ =1.87e-5 Pa-s, density ρ = 1.166 kg/m3, specific heat cp = 1005 Jkg/K, and thermal conductivity k = 0.0264 W/mK.\n\nTo enable the required physics models for Fins, expand Fins and double-click on “Models” and select the following models in the order of:\n\nThree dimensional\nSteady\nSolid\nSegregated flow\nConstant density\nSegregated solid energy\n\nAssign the Fluid and Fins physics continuums to Fluid and Fins regions, respectively.\n\nThe developing flow behavior in the offset-strip fin is neglected and simulated by using the periodic boundary condition. To create the boundary condition, the interface between the inlet and outlet at the fluid region needs to be set up first. Use Ctrl to select both Inlet and Outlet and right-click to create an interface.\n\nA new interface is created under the Interfaces folder. Set the topology of the interface to Periodic and the type of the interface to Fully-Developed Interface. \n\nSince the wall temperature at the top and bottom plates are considered as constant temperature boundary conditions, change the Fully Developed Energy Option to Constant Temperature Walls. Assigned Fluid.Top and Fluid.Bottom as the reference temperature. Also, a certain mass flow rate is specified in the simulation, and thus the Fully Developed Flow option needs to be changed to Mass Flow Rate. Set the mass flow rate under Physics Values. The default bulk inflow temperature is used, which is set as 300K.\n\nSet the thermal boundary conditions at the top and bottom plates. First, expand Fluid and set thermal specification to temperature and set the temperature to 400K.\n\nRepeat the process to the top plate in Fluid, and the top and bottom plates in Fins.\n\nChange the type of the boundary of Symmetry in Fluid and Fins to Symmetry Plane.\n\nIn this step, we will set up the scenes and monitors. This will allow us to check the results while running and after the simulation is finished. To visualize the temperature contour, create a scalar scene from the toolbar.\n\nChange the view of the scalar scene.\n\nIn the scalar scene, right-click on the legend and select the temperature function.\n\nExpand Scalar Scene 1 under Scenes, assign the whole regions to the Parts so that it will show in the window.\n\nBefore running the simulation, the stopping criteria needs to be reset. To make sure the results are dependable, the residuals of continuity, momentum, and energy should converge below a certain limit. Right-click on “Stopping Criteria” and create new criteria from the monitor. Choose energy on the list.\n\nAn energy criterion will be created. After that, set the “Logical Rule” to “And” and set the minimum limit for “Energy Criterion” to 1E-8.\n\nRepeat the previous steps and create the other three monitors for “Continuity”, “X-momentum”, and “Y-momentum”. Set the “Logical Rule” to “And”. Set the minimum limit for these criteria to 1E-6.\n\nThe maximum steps would be set at a relatively large number, which is 10000 in this case, so that a sufficient number of iterations are allowed for the convergence of parameters.\n\nSelect the green icon in toolbar and initialize the solution. Click run to start the calculation.\n\nPost processing is rather important because we need to examine the result and further analyze it. After finishing the simulation, check the residual plot and see if all the converging criteria are satisfied. The temperature contour would be shown in the scalar scene.\n\nTo have a better view of the flow temperature distribution, a cross-section at the middle of the fin height can be created. Right-click on Derived Parts and create a section plane.\n\nSet the coordinate and the normal vector of the plain. Select No Displayer. After finishing the settings, click Create.\n\nCreate a new scalar scene from the tool bar.\n\nChange the contour style to Smooth Filled to have a continuous distribution. Also, assign the part and the field function you would like to present in the scalar scene.\n\nThe scalar scene will show the temperature distribution at the selected plane section.\n\nSimilarly, by assigning the velocity magnitude to Scalar Field, the velocity contour will be shown in the scalar scene.\n\nThe pressure at the inlet and outlet of the fluid can be shown from the report. Right-click on Reports and select Surface Average. A new Surface Average 1 is created.\n\nSet the pressure as the field function. Assign two surfaces, the inlet and outlet of the fluid, to Parts.\n\nDouble-click on Surface Average 1, the average pressure at these two faces will show in the Output window.\n\nSimilarly, the inlet and outlet mean temperature of the fluid can also be obtained. Right-click on Reports and select Mass Flow Averaged. A new Mass Flow Averaged 1 is created.\n\nSet the temperature as the field function. Again, assign the inlet and outlet faces of the fluid to Parts. Double-click on Mass Flow Averaged 1, the mean temperature of the fluid at these two faces will show in the Output window."

In this example, developing flow across a cylindrical body is simulated. The flow model is simplified by using a two-dimensional mesh for simulation. The Pressure and skin-friction coefficients of the flow are plotted as a function of the radial angle of the cylinder, and the developing flow is observed across several time-steps through snapshots and animations.\n\nFigure 1 Schematic view of the model\n\nBuilding Geometry (Step 1)\n\nFigure 2. Create a new geometry\n\nTo begin with, the geometry of the fluid domain needs to be created. Right-click on the 3D-CAD Models and select “New” to start building a CAD model.\n\nFigure 3 Create a new sketch\n\nCreate a sketch by right-clicking on the XY plane and select “Create Sketch”.\n\nFigure 4 Grid spacing adjustment of the sketch\n\nFor our convenience, we will set the grid spacing of the sketch to 0.5 m.\n\nFigure 5 Create a circle in sketch\n\nCreate a circle and right-click at the circle to apply a fixation constraint.\n\nFigure 6 Apply length dimension\n\nRight-click on the circumference and apply radius dimension, make sure the radius is 0.5 m.\n\nFigure 7 Create a rectangle in sketch\n\nCreate three-point rectangle and encompass the circle\n\nFigure 2. Create a new geometry\n\nApply the length by right-click on the line and select “Apply length dimension”. When applying the distance between two objects, press ctrl and select both of the objects and right-click on one of them and select “Apply distance dimension”.\n\nClick “ok” to exit the sketch and extrude the sketch with the thickness of 1 m or any other arbitrary distance.\n\nFigure 9 Extrusion of the sketch\n\nFigure 9 Extrusion of the sketch\n\nThe fluid domain would be created as the figure.\n\nFigure 11 Exit the 3D-CAD mode\n\nClose 3D-CAD and go back to the main panel.\n\nFigure 12 Rename the 3D-CAD\n\nRename the body in the 3D-CAD to “Fluid”. \n\nTopology (Step 2)\n\nFigure 13 Creating a new geometry part\n\nIn the topology, the flow domain and the boundary faces would be determined in this step. Right-click on the Fluid and select “New Geometry part” and click ok to agree with the default settings.\n\nFigure 14 Create a geometry scene\n\nCreate a geometry scene from the toolbar.\n\nRename “Body1” to “Fluid” and expand the “Surfaces” under the fluid. Right-click on “Default” and select “Split by Patch”. Be sure you have created the geometry scene before you execute this command.\n\nFigure 15 Create a geometry scene an split the default surface\n\nName each boundary by selecting the surface from the numbers or from the geometry scene. Set the default surface that lies on the xy-plane as “Domain”. Set the other surfaces as specified in Figure 16. Click Close when all the surfaces are properly named. The named surfaces will be shown under Surfaces.\n\nFigure 16 Setting up the boundary surfaces\n\nRight-click on “Fluid” in “Parts” and select “Badge for 2D Meshing” and click ok. \n\nFigure 17 Badge for 2D meshing\n\nRight-click on “Badge for 2D Meshing” and select “Execute”. The solid icon under the “Surfaces” represents the flow domain and the empty icon represents the boundary. The “Default” surface will not be used in the future simulation.\n\nFigure 18 Execution of badge for 2D meshing\n\nAssign parts to regions and make a change on the boundary option  as shown in Figure 19. A “Region” would be created under “Region” folder. Rename the “Region” to “Fluid”. \n\nFigure 19 Creating simulation region\n\nMeshing (Step 3)\n\nBefore simulation, the flow domain needs to be discretized, and this step is also called meshing. We can do it by creating the mesh from “Fluid” under “Parts”. Use “Automated mesh” instead of “Automated mesh (2D)”.\n\nFigure 20 Creating mesh operation\n\nSelect “Surface Remesher”, “Polyhedral Mesher”, and “Prism Layer Mesher” as the meshing models. Click OK.\n\nFigure 21 Mesh model selection\n\nFigure 22 Change the base size of the mesh\n\n“Automated Mesh” will be created under “Operations”. Change the default controls to the following:\n\nBase size = 0.5 m (radius),Target Surface Size = 50 (%), Minimum Surface size = 50 (%)\n\nNumber of prism layers = 5, Prism layer stretching = 1.2, Prism layer total thickness = 20%\n\nCreate a “Surface Control” under “Custom Control”\n\nFigure 23 Creating custom mesh control\n\nSelect “Inlet”, “Outlet” and “Symmetry” in parts.\n\nFigure 24 Selecting surfaces for custom mesh control\n\nDisable the prism layer at the selected surfaces.\n\nFigure 25 Disabling Prism layers for the custom surfaces\n\nCreate another surface control and select the cylinder.\n\nFigure 26 Creating another surface control for the cylinder\n\nChange the “Target Surface Size” and “Minimum Surface Size” to “Custom”.  Make both of the relative sizes to 5%.\n\nFigure 27 Changing target & minimum surface size for cylinder\n\nEnable the Wake Refinement option. A new Wake Refinement would be created under the Values node. \n\nFigure 28 Setting up wake refinement for cylinder\n\nClick on the mesh icon in the toolbar to generate the mesh.\n\nFigure 29 Generating mesh\n\nFigure 30 Create a mesh scene\n\nCreate a mesh scene to check on the mesh in the window.\n\nThe final mesh can be visualized in the mesh scene. The mesh has been refined to better capture the high velocity gradient around the solid and the velocity change in the wake region. \n\nFigure 31 Final mesh\n\nPhysics Models and Boundary Conditions (Step 4)\n\nFigure 32 Physics model selection\n\nIn this section, physics models for the simulation and the boundary conditions would be determined. To enable the required physics models, double click on “Models” under “Continua” and select the following model:\n\nTwo Dimensional\nImplicit Unsteady\nGas\nSegregated Flow\nConstant Density\nLaminar\n\nFigure 33 Air Properties\n\nAfter finishing the selection of physics models, change the air density and dynamic viscosity to 1 kg/m3 and 5×10-2 N-s/m2  respectively.\n\nThe boundary conditions need to be specified in each surface. The default settings of all the boundaries would be wall, so we have to change them accordingly. For the inlet, change the type of the boundary to velocity inlet and set the value of velocity to 1 m/s.\n\nFigure 34 Inlet boundary conditions\n\nFigure 35 Outlet boundary conditions\n\nFor the outlet, change the type of the boundary to pressure outlet, and the pressure is 0 Pa in default.\n\nFigure 36 Symmetry boundary conditions\n\nFor the symmetry boundary, change the type of the boundary to “Symmetry Plane”.\n\nFigure 37 Cylinder boundary conditions\n\nLeave the cylinder boundary condition to the default value “Wall”.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Reynolds number for this exercise is 20.\n\nPreparing Simulation (Step 5)\n\nFigure 38 Updating solvers\n\nIn this step, we will set up the solvers for the simulation. Go to “Solvers”, change the time step to 0.2 s and the temporal discretization to 2nd-order.\n\nIn this step, we will set up the stopping criteria for the simulation. We can set the converging criteria by checking the residuals instead of giving a fixed iteration step alone. Right-click on “Stopping Criteria” and create a new monitor criterion. Create 3 monitors. After that, set the minimum limit to 1E-6  for all of them and also change the logical rule to “AND”. Also set the following values for the stopping criteria:\n\nMaximum Inner Iterations: 200\n\nMaximum Physical Time: 3000 s\n\nMaximum steps: disabled\n\nFrom the settings in the stopping criteria, the simulation will stop when the maximum iterations are reached and all of the residuals are below 10-6\n\nFigure 39 Setting up the stopping criteria\n\nFigure 40 Create a scalar scene\n\nNext, we will set up the scenes and monitors. This will allow us to check the results while running and after the simulation is finished. To visualize the velocity contour, create a scalar scene from the tool bar.\n\nFigure 41 Select the function of scalar scene\n\nIn the scalar scene, right-click on the legend and select velocity magnitude function.\n\nNext, we will prepare the lift plot. Right-click on Report and select “Force Coefficient” and rename the “Force Coefficient 1” to “Lift Coefficient”. Change the direction to [0.0, 1.0. 0.0] and assign “Fluid.Cylinder” to “Parts. Then Right-click on “Lift Coefficient” and create monitor and plot from report.\n\nFigure 42 Setting up the lift coefficient plot\n\nFigure 43 Setting up the solution history\n\nNext, we will set up the scenes and monitors. This will allow us to check the results while running and after the simulation is finished. To visualize the velocity contour, create a scalar scene from the tool bar.\n\nBefore running the simulation, initial values should be given. Go to “Initial Condition” and set the intial velocity as [0.0, 0.0]. Next, select the green flag icon in tool bar and initialize the solution. \n\nFigure 44 Solution initialization\n\nDrag the “Solution Time” under Tools to the scene.\n\nFigure 45 Adding solution time to the scalar scene\n\nFigure 46 Run the solution\n\nFinally, click on the run icon to start the simulation.\n\nPost Processing (Step 6)\n\nPost processing is rather important because we need to examine the result and further analyze it. After finishing the simulation, check the residual plot and see if all the converging criteria are satisfied. The velocity contour would be shown in the scalar scene.\n\nFigure 47 Velocity contour\n\nDouble-click on the lift coefficient plot in “Plots”.\n\nFigure 48 Lift coefficient plot\n\nFigure 49 Creating a vector scene\n\nFor a better view of the vortex patterns around the cylinder, create a vector scene from the tool bar. Change the Relative Length to 2% to have a better view. A pair of steady vortex can be seen behind the cylinder.\n\nNext, we will create a Drag Coefficient report. Right-click on report and create another force coefficient. Rename it to Drag Coefficient. Assign Fluid.Cylinder to Parts, and double-click on Drag Coefficient to open the report.\n\nFigure 50 Creating a drag coefficient report\n\nNext, we will create a plot of the drag coefficient distribution. Right-click on derived part and select threshold. Extract the upper surface of the cylinder. After finishing the settings, click Create.\n\nFigure 51 Drag coefficient distribution across the cylinder\n\nRight-click on Plots and create a new XY plot. Assign the threshold to the Parts.\n\nFigure 52 Creating an XY plot\n\nFigure 53 Creating a new cylindrical coordinate system\n\nCreate a new X type (Angle). Go to Tools and find the Coordinate Systems. Right-click on Local Coordinate Systems and create a cylindrical coordinate (r, θ, z). A new Cylindrical 1 will be created.\n\nRight-click Field Functions and create a scalar function. Right-click on the new function and rename it to Angle.\n\nFigure 54 Creating an angle field function\n\nGo back to XY Plot 1. Change the X Type and Scalar Function.\n\nFigure 55 Updating X type in the XY plot\n\nCreate a new Y type. Assign the pressure coefficient and skin friction coefficient to the scalar function of Y Type 1 and Y Type 2, respectively.\n\nFigure 56 Creating and updating the Y types in the XY plot\n\nThis gives us the following plot:\n\nFigure 57 Creating and updating the Y types in the XY plot\n\nNote: The reference velocity (1 m/s) and reference density (1 kg/m3) of pressure coefficient and skin friction coefficient can be set under Tools -> Field Functions.\n\nTo view the results at different time steps, right-click on demo and create recorded solution view. A demo would be generated under solution views. Drag demo under Solution Views to the scalar scene. \n\nFigure 58 Creating and updating the Y types in the XY plot\n\nChange the state and the scalar scene would show the results at the corresponding time step.\n\nFigure 59 Viewing scalar scenes at different time steps\n\nFigure 60 Turning video animation on for solution view\n\nTo create a video animation out of different time step still images, Go to Solution Views and set the animation mode to “Solution Time”. “Solution Time Animation” node would be created.\n\nGo to the scalar scene. Click the recording icon in the toolbar. Set the frame rate and the animation length.\n\n0.2 [s/time step] x 10 [time step/s] x 50 [s] = 100 [s]\n\nThis will render a video file on a specified address on your computer.\n\nFigure 61 Recording the animation into a video file"

In this example, fully developed flow in a circular pipe is simulated. Because the flow is axisymmetric at the center of the flow cross-section, the model can be simplified by using axisymmetric boundary condition at the centerline. In addition, the entrance effect is excluded using periodic boundary conditions at inlet and outlet surfaces. \n\nFigure 1 Schematic view of the model\n\nBuilding Geometry (Step 1)\n\nFigure 2 Create a new geometry\n\nTo begin with, the geometry of the fluid domain needs to be created. Right-click on the 3D-CAD Models and select “New” to start building a CAD model.\n\nFigure 3 Create a new sketch\n\nCreate a sketch by right-clicking on the XY plane and select “Create Sketch”.\n\nFigure 4 Grid spacing adjustment of the sketch\n\nFor our convenience, we will set the grid spacing of the sketch to 10 mm.\n\nFigure 5 Draw a rectangle in sketch\n\nDraw a rectangle that starts from the origin and right-click to apply the fixation constraint at the sketch origin so that the location of the bottom left corner of the rectangle will be fixed.\n\nFigure 6 Apply length dimension\n\nRight-click on the lines and select “Apply Length Dimension” to specify the length.\n\nFigure 7 Dimensions of the rectangle\n\nSet the length to 3 m in x-direction and 0.1 m in y-direction.\n\nFigure 8 Exit sketch mode\n\nClick “ok” to exit the sketch.\n\nFigure 9 Extrusion of the sketch\n\nExtrude the sketch with the thickness of 10 mm. The thickness can be arbitrary since the simulation is only two-dimensional.\n\nFigure 10 Dimensions of the rectangle\n\nThe extruded geometry is the shaded area shown in the figure.\n\nFigure 11 Exit the 3D-CAD mode\n\nClose 3D-CAD and go back to the main panel.\n\nFigure 12 Rename the 3D-CAD\n\nRename the body in the 3D-CAD to “Fluid”. \n\nTopology (Step 2)\n\nFigure 13 Creating a new geometry part\n\nIn the topology, the flow domain and the boundary faces would be determined in this step. Right-click on the Fluid and select “New Geometry part” and click ok to agree with the default settings.\n\nFigure 14 Create a geometry scene\n\nCreate a geometry scene from the toolbar.\n\nFigure 15 Split the default surface\n\nRename “Body1” to “Fluid” and expand the “Surfaces” under the fluid. Right-click on “Default” and select “Split by Patch”. Be sure you have created the geometry scene before you execute this command.\n\nFigure 16 Setting up the boundary surfaces\n\nName each boundary by selecting the surface from the numbers or from the geometry scene. Set the surface that lies on the xy-plane as “Domain”.\n\nFigure 17 Badge for 2D meshing\n\nRight-click on “Fluid” in “Parts” and select “Badge for 2D Meshing” and click ok. \n\nFigure 18 Execution of badge for 2D meshing\n\nRight-click on “Badge for 2D Meshing” and select “Execute”. The flow domain will now be converted to 2D. The solid icon under the “Surfaces” represents the flow domain and the empty icon represents the boundary. The “Default” surface will not be used in the future simulation.\n\nFigure 19 Creating simulation region\n\nAssigned parts to regions and make a change on the boundary option. A “Region” would be created under “Region” folder. Rename the “Region” under to “Fluid”. \n\nFigure 20 Creating mesh operation\n\nBefore simulation, the flow domain needs to be discretized, and this step is also called meshing. We can do it by creating the mesh from “Fluid” under “Parts”. Use “Automated mesh” instead of “Automated mesh (2D)”.\n\nFigure 21 Mesh model selection\n\nSelect “Surface Remesher” and “Trimmed Cell Mesher” as the meshing models.\n\nFigure 22 Change the base size of the mesh\n\n“Automated Mesh” will be created under “Operations”.\n\nBase size = 0.1 m (radius)\n\nTarget Surface Size = 5 (%)\n\nMinimum Surface size = 5 (%)\n\nFigure 23 Generating mesh\n\nClick on the icon in the toolbar to generate the mesh.\n\nFull Gallery \n\nFigure 24 Create a mesh scene\n\nReplace with your text\n\nFigure 25 Final mesh\n\nThe final mesh can be visualized in the mesh scene.\n\nPhysics Models and Boundary Conditions (Step 4)\n\nFigure 26 Physics model selection\n\nIn this section, physics models for the simulation and the boundary conditions would be determined. To enable the required physics models, double click on “Models” under “Continua” and deactivate “Two Dimensional” and select the following models in the order of:\n\nAxisymmetric\nSteady\nGas\nSegregated flow\nConstant density\nLaminar\n\nFigure 27 Air properties\n\nAfter finishing the selection of physics models, change the air density and dynamic viscosity to 1 kg/m3 and 2×10-3, respectively.\n\nFigure 28 Thermal specification at the wall\n\nThe boundary conditions need to be specified in each surface. The default settings of all the boundaries would be wall, so we have to change them accordingly. In order to simulate the fully developed flow, the inlet and outlet boundaries have to be specified as periodic boundaries. Select Fluid.Inlet and use ctrl to select Fluid.Outlet and right-click to select “Create Interface”. \n\nFigure 29 Thermal specification at the wall\n\nChange the type of the interface to “Fully Developed Interface” and the topology to “Periodic”.\n\nFigure 30 Fully developed flow option\n\nChanged the “Fully Developed Flow Option” to “Mass Flow Rate”.\n\nFigure 31 Thermal specification at the wall\n\nSpecify the mass flow rate under “Physics Values”. With the velocity of 1 m/s, the mass flow rate under axisymmetric condition can be calculated as follows:\n\nwhere ρ is the density, vm is the mean velocity, and A is the flow area.\n\nFigure 32 Under-relaxation factor\n\nThe Reynolds number for this exercise can be achieved as\n\nwhere μ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nTo get a better convergence for periodic boundary condition, go to “Solvers” and change the “Under-Relaxation Factor” of velocity and pressure to 0.9 and 0.1, respectively.\n\nFigure 33 Axis boundary condition\n\nAt the axis boundary, change the type of the boundary to “Axis”.\n\nFigure 34 Wall boundary condition\n\nLeave the wall boundary as default.\n\nPreparing Simulation (Step 5)\n\nFigure 35 Create a scalar scene\n\nIn this step, we will set up the scenes and monitors. This will allow us to check the results while running and after the simulation is finished. To visualize the velocity contour, create a scalar scene from the tool bar.\n\nFigure 36 Select the function of scalar scene\n\nIn the scalar scene, right-click on the legend and select velocity magnitude function.\n\nFigure 37 Velocity vector scene\n\nThe velocity vector can be seen in the vector scene.\n\nFigure 38 Deactivation of maximum iteration steps\n\nBefore running the simulation, the stopping criteria needs to be set. The maximum step of the “Stopping Criteria” can be set to 5000 so that the number of iterations would not exceed this value.\n\nFigure 39 Create new converging criterion from monitor\n\nRight-click on “Stopping Criteria” and create new criterion from monitor.\n\nFigure 40 The minimum converging limit for continuity criteria\n\nChoose continuity in the list. After that, set the “Logical Rule” to “And” and set the minimum limit for “Continuity Criterion” to 1E-6. \n\nFigure 41 Create new converging criteria from monitor\n\nRepeat the previous steps and create other three monitors for “X-momentum”, and “Y-momentum”. Set the “Logical Rule” to “And”. Set the minimum limit for these criteria to 1E-6 as well. \n\nFigure 42 Solution initialization\n\nFrom the settings in the stopping criteria, the simulation will stop when the maximum iteration step is reached or all of the residuals are below 10-6. Before running the simulation, initial values should be given. Go to “Initial Condition” and set the intial velocity as [1.0, 0.0], which is the same as the velocity for periodic boundary condition. Then select the icon in tool bar and initialize the solution.\n\nFigure 43 Run the solution\n\nClick run to start the calculation.\n\nPost Processing (Step 6)\n\nPost processing is rather important because we need to examine the result and further analyze it. After finishing the simulation, check the residual plot and see if all the converging criteria are satisfied.\n\nFigure 44 Residual plot\n\nThe velocity contour would be shown in the scalar scene.\n\nFigure 45 Velocity contour\n\nTo include the boundary velocity (velocity at the wall) in the contour, change the contour style to “Smooth Filled”. The range of the legend would become 0 m/s to 1.9918 m/s.\n\nFigure 46 Smooth filled temperature contour\n\nThe velocity vector can be shown in the vector scene. \n\nFigure 47 Smooth filled temperature contour\n\nTo check the velocity at the inlet and outlet, right-click on “Report” and select “Surface Average”.\n\nFigure 48 Surface average report\n\nUnder the newly created “Surface Average 1”, assigned velocity magnitude to “Field Function” and assigned Fluid.Inlet [Interface 1] and Fluid.Outlet [Interface 1] to “Parts”.\n\nFigure 49 Create a report for mass flow rate\n\nDouble click on “Surface Average 1” than you can get the mean velocity at inlet and outlet.\n\nFigure 50 Mass flow rate at the outlet\n\nFor further examination, we can create a line probe and see how the velocity varies in the radial direction. Right-click on “Derived Parts” and create a line from the menu. Set the coordinate of point 1 and point 2 to (3 m, 0 m, 0 m) and (3 m, 0.1 m, 0 m), respectively. Select “No Displayer”.\n\nFigure 51 Create a line probe\n\nRight-click on “Plot” and create a XY plot.\n\nFigure 52 Plot for the values on the line probe\n\nCreate a new XY Plot and assign the “Line Probe” to the parts in the plot properties.\n\nFigure 53 Select the parts for plot\n\nAssign x-axis to left axis and change the “Vector Quantity” of x-axis to (0, 1, 0). Likewise, assign y-axis to bottom axis. Also click on “Smooth Values”.\n\nFigure 54 Settings of x-axis and y-axis\n\nExpand “Y Types” and select velocity magnitude in the scalar function for velocity profile.\n\nFigure 55 Scalar function selection for the plot\n\nThe final velocity profile will show in the plot.\n\nFigure 56 Velocity profiles\n\nTo obtain the average pressure at the inlet and outlet, right-click on “Report” and select “Surface Average”.\n\nFigure 57 Surface average report\n\nUnder the newly created “Surface Average 2”, assigned static pressure to “Field Function” and assigned Fluid.Inlet [Interface 1] and Fluid.Outlet [Interface 1] to “Parts”.\n\nFigure 58 Create a report for average pressure\n\nDouble click on “Surface Average 2” than you can get the average pressure at inlet and outlet.\n\nFigure 59 Average pressure at inlet and outlet\n\nThe pressure drop between inlet and outlet can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n\nΔP is the pressure drop, f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the simulated pipe length, D is the pipe diameter, ρ is the density, and vm is the mean velocity. Therefore, Darcy friction factor can be derived as\n\nCompare the result with the theoretical friction factor for pipe flow in laminar regime, which can be obtained from"

Commands/tools that will be exposed to users in this example are Orient View, Sketch environment, User Rolls, Quick pick, Convert to Reference curve, curve rule, symmetric extrude and mouse clicks.\n\nIntroduction to the problem\n\nFlywheels are mechanical devices that store rotational energy. They are used mostly in systems where the primary energy source does not supply continuous energy. Since Flywheels have high moment of inertia, they resist change in rotational speed. This property finds use in gyroscopes. In this Tutorial a simple Flywheel will be designed, with the main aim to introduce users to NX environment.\n\nFigure 1\n\nGetting Started\n\nStart NX 12.0 (Desktop App) and click on New to start a new file. Under model file, save your file to desired directory, and remember to choose units for the model here. It is always good to be consistent with units, and it is strongly advised to select the right ‘units’ filter while a new file is created.\n\nFigure 2\n\nTo work through NX some mouse operations are important, some of the operations have been shown here. For detailed operation check Siemens NX documentation.\n\nFigure 3\n\nWhile following through the tutorial’s snapshots, some users may notice that certain tools are not available in the same locations. This is because user roles might be different. This example has been built with advanced role, which provides a wider set of tools to support straightforward and advanced tasks. Change roles on the resource bar.\n\nFigure 4\n\nBy default, the view is on isometric, to change views one can use orient view found on the top Border bar.\n\nFigure 5\n\n2D Sketching\n\nDesigning involves constructing a 2D sketch and then converting this into 3D model using certain features like Extrude, Revolve etc. To draw 2D sketch NX offers to Environments ‘Direct Sketch Environment’ and ‘Sketch in Task Environment’. \n\nFigure 6\n\nIn this tutorial series, Direct sketch environment is used. But users with experience in other CAD softwares might appreciate the Sketch in Task Environment better.\n\nClick on Direct Sketch and choose the appropriate plane to draw the sketch. If desired plane cannot be selected easily, use orient tool to get the desired view/plane upfront.\n\nFigure 7\n\nNow choose circle from the Direct sketch tab and click on the sketch origin to draw a circle of desired dimension.  If mouse pointer hovers over an existing object (here a point) for a few seconds before selecting the object with a click, a QuickPick tool is generated. QuickPick tool helps in selecting desired objects when multiple curves/points exist on a given location. You can change the delay time for QuickPick under File>Preferences>Selection Preferences.\n\nFigure 8\n\nDraw all concentric Circles as seen in the Front view shown in Introduction. Reference circle of 6.5 inches Diameter is drawn as a normal curve initially.\n\nFigure 9\n\nWhile Circle command/tool is selected, hover the mouse horizontal in line with x axis on the Φ6.5 inches Circle, until a brown dashed guide line appears now drop it on the Φ6.5 Circle. These guide lines, and cue on the bottom Cue/Status line guides one during various tasks in NX.\n\nFigure 10\n\nNow the other Φ1inch Circles need not be drawn separately. Circular pattern operation can be performed. Under Direct sketch tab, find Pattern tool. In the Pattern tool change Linear pattern to circular Pattern. Now select Φ1 circle as curve to pattern and Φ6.5 circle as the rotation point. Under Angular direction change spacing to ‘count and span’.\n\nFigure 11\n\nNow Φ6.5 circle can be converted into a reference circle, as this is just a construction curve for the circular pattern.\n\nFigure 12\n\nNow Finish the sketch. It’s a good practice to finish the sketch.\n\nFigure 13\n\nFigure 14\n\nExtrusion to 3D Model\n\nThe final step is to convert the 2D skeleton to a Flywheel. To do this the sketch is extruded. Click on extrude to pull up the Extrude Dialog.\n\nBy default the curve rule on the top Border bar will be Infer curve. Change this to Region boundary curve. Users are strongly encouraged to check effects of different curve tools on selecting the same sketch. Although Region boundary curve rule is used here, Infer curves is usually more powerful and useful. \n\nFigure 15\n\nNow select different boundaries \n\nFigure 16\n\nFigure 17\n\nFigure 18\n\nFigure 19\n\nExample By: Parikshit Boregowda\n"

After working on designing, ordering &/or manufacturing required parts and building the car, the team sets aside some time before the competition to test their car and gather data. Besides making sure that the build-quality is up to the mark, the testing phase gives the team the performance data that is invaluable when you are competing against other world-class teams. Even though FSAE releases the course layouts prior to the competition, replicating the track to do test runs on it is unimaginably difficult.\n\nOne possible solution to that is lap simulations, and this is objective of this project. Using Simcenter Amesim, we first build the suspension model, perform a parametric analysis on the suspension hard-points to finalize the design. I have chosen to dive deeper into the suspension subsystem because it is critical to replicate the behavior of the actual car. With Simcenter Amesim, you can build detailed models of any one or all your subsystems: suspension, aerodynamics, engine, etc. Once the suspension model is validated, we integrate the different subsystems into a single 15DOF vehicle model. Then, we import the characteristics of each real subsystem to replicate their performance in the vehicle model. For example, for the chassis subsystem, we import parameters like pitch, roll, yaw inertias, sprung and unsprung masses to name a few. We then, use the sensor models or other inbuilt tools to validate the performance of the vehicle model with the data from the real car. The final step would be to import the track of interest and incorporate path-following control to make sure that the vehicle model follows the reference trajectory.\n\nFigure 1: Roadmap for Lap Simulation; 1. Design 2019 BCMS suspension in Amesim 2. Parametric analysis of the hardpoint locations 3. Design an Amesim model of the 2019 BCMS car 4. Import the 2019 FSAE Endurance track into Amesim 5. Incorporate path-following control to the vehicle model\n\nSuspension Design in Simcenter Amesim\nAutomotive Suspensions\n\nThe two most commonly used suspension systems in the automotive industry are the double-wishbone and McPherson strut suspensions. Both configurations have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The McPherson strut is relatively simple suspension model because of the fewer number of links to the chassis while the increased number of hardpoints in the double-wishbone system gives the designer more degrees of freedom to achieve the required performance characteristics. In addition to that, using the double-wishbone enables the designer to lower the ride height of the car to a much higher degree. For these reasons, the double-wishbone suspension is very commonly used in racecar applications as a lower center of gravity is a desirable attribute. In accordance with that, 2019 BCMS team also adopted this configuration.\n\nFigure 2: Double-wishbone and McPherson strut suspension\n\nSimcenter Amesim Model\n\nIn this section, the Amesim model for the double-wishbone suspension is presented. The model is built using different blocks available in the 3D Mechanical library. This model is now available as a template in Simcenter Amesim. To use this model to design your suspension, you need to either import the hardpoint locations, shown in Fig. 3, or manually enter them in the Global Parameters list.\n\nFigure 3: Double-wishbone suspension hardpoints\n\nA screenshot of the template in Amesim is shown in the image below. This model takes the amount of steering rack input, wheel vertical motion, and the forces and moments acting on the wheel center as the inputs. And it computes the toe, camber, self-rotating angles along with the variation in wheelbase and half-track. This particular model can also be used for generating Kinematic & Compliance analysis data which will be discussed later.\n\nFigure 4: Double-wishbone suspension template\n\nOnce the hardpoint locations are set, we can visualize and animate the suspension model based on our inputs using Amesim’s 3D Assembly block. All we need to do is import that block and Amesim will build the 3D model of our suspension and animate it.\n\nParametric Analysis of Hardpoints\n\nNow that we have completed building a base suspension model in Amesim, we can use Amesim’s Batch Analysis feature to do a parametric analysis and visualize the effect that the change in certain inputs will have on the outputs of interest. To demonstrate this, we take the case where each suspension hardpoint locations were shifted by 0.5” in every direction and the respective characteristic curves like camber and toe were plotted against each other. This, along with other key performance parameters like caster, KPI etc., are used to finalize the locations of the hardpoints. \n\nFigure 6: Batch plots for parametric analysis for changes in hardpoint K\n\nVehicle Model\n\nWhen building a model that will be used for simulations, the most crucial aspect is to maintain a decent fidelity in the model. If not, the simulation model will not behave like its real-life twin and the data collected from the simulations will not be useful for making strategic decisions in the real-world scenario.\n\nFigure 7: High-level breakdown of an automobile into subsystems\n\nTo maintain a respectable fidelity in vehicle simulations, the automobile has to be broken down into subsystems and the performance of each subsystem has to be replicated in the vehicle model to a desired degree of fidelity. Amesim’s modular block-building nature allows you to connect different subsystems and define the respective characteristics individually, if required, with ease. In addition to that, the complexity of each model can be chosen based on the user’s requirement using the Submodel mode. This allows the user to set the degree of fidelity of each subsystem depending on the area of application.  \n\nThe following image shows a fully decked up vehicle model built in Simcenter Amesim using the Mechanical, Control, Powertrain and Vehicle Dynamics libraries. You can see that all the different subsystems are connected to a central 15DOF Chassis model. As I have previously mentioned, apart from the necessary subsystems, the other subsystems’ influence can be ignored by not including them in the model. For example, if you do not have the aerodynamic characteristics of your real car or you just do not want to consider its effect, you can remove the blocks related to it.  \n\nFigure 8: Vehicle model in Simcenter Amesim\n\nKinematic & Compliance Analysis\n\nIn vehicle performance simulations, the interaction between the vehicle and the track beneath is crucial, and because the unsprung mass is the link between both, modeling its performance will define the interplay. To enable this, the 15DOF Chassis model requires us to provide data which define the suspension’s behavior with respect to the movement of the wheel and the forces that are acting on it. In order get that data, we need to carry out an analysis called the Kinematic & Compliance analysis.  \n\nThe Kinematic section treats the suspension components as kinematic elements where the forces and moments are not considered. The data gives us a mapping from vertical displacement of the wheel (Z), steering rack input (Yn) and the influence of the opposite wheel (for a linked suspension) to toe, camber, dive angles, wheelbase and half-track variations. The compliance segment gives the same outputs but based on the forces and moments acting on the wheel. \n\nFigure 9: Suspension Kinematics & Compliance;\n\nUsually, getting this data is a very tedious process, but Amesim has a dedicated inbuilt app that does this for us. We just need to import the app to the suspension model, shown in Fig. 4, and set the range of wheel movement, steering inputs and anticipated vertical force on the wheel.\n\nFigure 10: KnC Data Generator App\n\nThe app will give us the data which we should save and import into our 15DOF Chassis model. Once we do that, our suspension’s dynamic behavior will be like that of our real vehicle. Along with the kinematic tables data and the compliance coefficients, the app also gives us information about other key suspension geometric parameters like king-pin inclination angle, caster, rollcenter height, etc. These parameters can be used to validate the suspension model with already existing data to get sense check. BCMS Suspension team gave me the data from their suspension model in Optimum K. I used that to validate the suspension model, as seen in Fig.  \n\nFigure 11: Suspension model validation using KnC app with Optimum K data\n\nVirtual Sensor Models\n\nFor the simulation to be accurate, the vehicle model that we are building needs to be of good fidelity. Then, after applying control to the developed model, the collected data of the dynamics of the vehicle can be used for analysis. Now that we have validated the suspension model in the previous section, we can make use of Amesim’s sensor models to measure key vehicle characteristics like yaw rate, longitudinal and side slip (the tire modeling section will be added to in the next version of the tutorial), camber of each wheel to name a few. This “measured” data can be used to validate the dynamics of the simulation model with actual data collected from the real vehicle during the testing phase. We can develop the same track or scenarios that were used to collect the data from the real vehicle in Simcenter Amesim to run the simulation model. That will give us a way to compare data of the two models (real and simulation) over the same track.\n\nFigure 12: Different types of sensors available in Simcenter Amesim\n\nImport Reference Track\n\nOnce the vehicle model has been validated, we can start thinking about incorporating control to the model such that it follows the reference track. One final step before that is to import the track of interest into Amesim. The first step is to find the track layout in SVG format. If the track is not available in this format, we can use software like Inkscape to convert PDF or PNG into SVG format. In addition to that, we also need Open Street Map data of the track. If the track is well renowned, we can find this in Open Street Map editor. If not, we need to create/upload our track on to OSM and then download the data. Amesim documentation regarding this has some steps to generate the required OSM data.\n\nFigure 14: Inputs required to import the track to Amesim\n\nThe next step would be to generate the profile waypoint information that will be used by the Trajectory Designer app to define the track trajectory in data points. This is done by using Ametrack app which can be opened from the VDGROUND0 component used for ground description. The app takes the OSM data as input. Then, open the Trajectory Designer app, import the SVG file and the waypoints generated by Ametrack. This app will generate the data points which will be used by the lateral controller to make the vehicle follow the track. In addition to that, the app will also generate a reference velocity map that will be used by the longitudinal controller to control the speed of the vehicle through the track. The directories of these corresponding data files must be carefully specified as inputs for both the controller models. For more details on how to use the app, kindly follow the comprehensive Amesim documentation of the same.  \n\nFigure 15: Trajectory app designer in Simcenter Amesim\n\nPath-following Control\n\nTo summarize what we did till now, we first developed the double-wishbone suspension model and used Amesim’s inbuilt apps for validation and Kinematic and Compliance. Then, we built an integrated vehicle model accounting for all the necessary subsystems with varying fidelity based on the application. Then, we used sensors to measure variables for validation. The last step was to import the track of interest into Amesim. Now that we have our vehicle model and our track, the final piece of the puzzle is to design a controller that controls the vehicle such that it follows our track trajectory. \n\nFigure 16: Lap simulation schematic\n\nFigure 17: Control logic\n\nAmesim accomplishes this by combining two controllers. One controller is setup to control the throttle and brake inputs to the vehicle model. The magnitude of the control input is computed such the actual vehicle velocity matches closely with the reference velocity generated by the Trajectory Designer app. This is done using a feedforward-feedback control strategy. Amesim uses a Model Predictive controller for the lateral control of the vehicle to effectively reduce the error between the trajectory and the path followed by the vehicle. Controller parameters like the feedback gain for the longitudinal controller and prediction horizon, control horizon, state error and control input weight matrices for MPC must be tuned to achieve desired performance. We can use the displacement sensors to plot the trajectory followed by the vehicle to check whether our model is behaving as planned or not. In addition to that, we can use the base vehicle dynamics animation model ‘Vehicle_Dynamics_Global_Analysis’ to visualize our vehicle following the track of interest. \n\nFigure 19: Roadmap for Lap Simulation; 1.

One notable exception are the uterine myometerial smooth muscle cells during the third trimester of pregnancy; which coincides with the time at which the majority of fetal elastin is produced. Our lab is investigating the interactions of pregnancy hormones and mechanical forces in order to understand the mechanisms involved and to determine the conditions necessary for other adult cells that produce to produce and assemble functional elastic fibers.\n\nSkin tissue engineering\n\nEngineered skin substitutes provide improved wound closure times and reduce the need for autologous donor skin needed to close chronic wounds or full thickness skin losses. These substitutes can be used to model changes that occur in the skin such as after the application of negative pressure wound therapy.\n\nUterine Fibroids\n\nIn collaboration with Drs. Thomas and Rios in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, we are studying the effects of mechanical stiffness and stretch on uterine fibroid and myometrial cell viability and proliferation. This data as well as study of mechanosensitive pathways is necessary to achieve our long term goal of finding a nonhormonal treatment for uterine fibroids that will shrink the fibroids without harming the surrounding myometrial tissue."

Diagnostic measurements are performed to evaluate persons who may have inhaled or ingested radioactive materials arising from occupational or environmental exposure, accidents, or incidents of radiological malfeasance. Detectors measure radiation emitted from radioactive material deposited in the body. There are two large examination rooms, each with at least one array of detectors for performing direct, in vivo measurements. Each room has thick steel walls to reduce interferences from natural background radiation. The lab also has a reception area and a change room with a shower where a person can change into surgical scrubs before the examination.\n\n\nMeasurements of persons having a potential for inhalation or ingestion of radioactive materials are performed by placing detectors over the chest while the person sits comfortably in a chair for approximately 30 minutes. The room is also equipped with a television and radio for the comfort of the person being examined.\n\n\nThe lab is also used to test anthropometric structures designed and fabricated at UC.  These structures (i.e., phantoms) are used to calibrate direct in vivo measurements of uranium and transuranic radionuclides that may be deposited in the lungs, liver, and skeleton. Calibration phantoms have also been developed for measuring radioactive materials in wounds and lymph nodes.  These phantoms are used at many national and governmental laboratories around the world including the International Atomic Energy Agency. The UC In Vivo Radiation Measurement Laboratory is the only research facility of its kind in the United States that is dedicated solely for education and research. The University of Cincinnati broad scope radioactive materials license permits use of all forms of radioactive materials, including uranium, plutonium, and other transuranic radionuclides.  Thus, the UC In Vivo Radiation Measurement Lab is able to perform measurements for any of these radionuclides in response to accidents and incidents of radiological malfeasance    \n\n\nLocation\n\nIn Vivo Radiation Measurement Laboratory\n5997 Center Hill Avenue\nCincinnati, OH 45224\nPhone: 513-641-2763\n\n\nLaboratory for Environmental Radiological Assessment & Measurement and Nuclear Forensics Research\n\nThe UC Nuclear Radiochemistry Laboratory and the Laboratories for Environmental Radiological Assessment and Measurement are located on the UC campus. These labs include resources to perform high sensitivity alpha and gamma spectrometry, beta proportional and liquid scintillation counting to analyze any type of radioactive material including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and other special nuclear materials. The radiochemistry laboratory has developed high sensitivity radiochemical methods for analysis of natural radioactivity in a variety of biological and environmental samples using neutron activation analysis. Natural and artificial matrix standards are also designed and prepared using radioactive materials with traceability to the National Institute for Standards and Technology.\n\n\nIndirect measurement of internally deposited radioactive material is accomplished by radiochemical analysis of samples collected from persons who may have been exposed to a radioactive substance.   Samples typically consist of excreta (urine or feces), hair, tissue, or other biological tissue.  Measurements of environmental contamination are also performed using samples of soil, vegetation, air, or air filters to determine the content of natural, industrial, or technologically enhanced radioactive material. The laboratory has eighty alpha spectrometers, seven high resolution gamma spectrometers, and ample facilities for radiochemical analysis and measurement of nearly any number and type of samples.  Procedures are available for high sensitivity, isotopic analysis of plutonium, uranium, and thorium as well as gross alpha, gross beta and fission product measurements.  Isotopic gamma spectrometry can also be performed in combination with specific radiochemical separations for nuclear forensics analyses to reveal the age of an intercepted nuclear material.\n\n\nOur principle mission at the University of Cincinnati Nuclear and Radiological Engineering Program is to train students to become professional nuclear or radiological engineers, health physicists, or industrial safety professionals.  The U. S. Departments of Energy and Homeland Security have supported our academic research program in Nuclear Forensics, which trains graduate students from engineering, chemistry and physics to pursue professional positions in nuclear forensics within the national laboratory system. Our facilities include state-of-the-art instruments accommodate research activities conducted by students and faculty    \n\n\nLocation\n\nCenter for Radiological Assessment and Measurement\n501 Old Chemistry\nUniversity of Cincinnati (West campus)\nCincinnati, OH 45221\nPhone: 513-556-2052"

Mechanical based techniques such as nanoindentation or nano scratching are feasible but direct contact of tool with the workpiece in such processes causes large scale tool wear. In this research, the target specific machining capability of single point tool based processes is combined with the hard and brittle material machining abilities of abrasives, to achieve Vibration Assisted Nano Impact-machining by Loose Abrasives (VANILA process) - a novel hybrid nanomachining process that uses a single-point AFM probe with loose abrasives and vibration assistance to perform target specific impact-based machining of nanoscale features on hard and brittle materials.\n\nProcess Principle and Nanomachining Results\n\nVANILA process is a tip-based nanomachining process that uses a single-point AFM probe with loose abrasives and vibration assistance (Figure 1) and can be used to perform target specific impact-based machining of brittle materials at nanoscale. The VANILA process is conducted on an atomic force microscope (AFM) shown in Figure 2 as the platform and a slurry of nano diamond powders smaller than 10 nm which is introduced between the tool and the workpiece. The tool used is a tapping mode AFM tip and it is vibrated constantly while maintaining a constant distance from the workpiece as shown in figure 1a. This results in continuous hammering of suspended nano diamond powders which in turn impact the impact the workpiece surface repeatedly resulting in nanoscale material removal (figures 1b and 1c). Some of the nanoscale features machined by VANILA process are shown in Figures 3-5.\n\nFigure 1 Schematic Diagram of the VANILA process a) Vibrating tool hammers the diamond nano-particles b) Nano-particle impact the workpiece surface causing material removal c) Repeated impacts of diamond nanoparticles resulting in Nanocavity formation on workpiece surface\n\nFigure 2 Experimental Setup\n\nFigure 3 AFM images of nano-cavity (2) machined through VANILA Process (machining time 20 seconds)\n\nFigure 4 Topography of nanocavities (Pattern 1)\n\nFigure 5 Topography of nanocavities (Pattern 2)\n\nThe tool used in VANILA process is an AFM probe which has a nanoscale tip radius.  The tool wear is found to be affected by the impact velocity of the abrasives and the effective tool tip as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 7 Study of Tool wear"

It is a non-conventional material removal process in which the workpiece to be machined is made the anode and the tool is made the cathode of an electrolytic cell (Figure 1).\n\nECM has many advantages over traditional machining such as its applicability regardless of material hardness, no tool wear, high material removal rate, smooth and bright surface, and production of components of complex geometry. ECM is an effective method for producing a wide variety of parts for the aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical industries: for example turbine blades, engine castings, bearing cages, gears, dies and molds, artillery projectiles, and surgical implants.\n\nPulse electrochemical micromachining (PECMM) is a variation of ECM in which instead of using direct current, a pulsed current is used as the power source for electrochemical micromachining. The improved electrolyte flow condition in the inter electrode gap, enhanced localization of anodic dissolution, and small and stable gaps found in PECMM lead to higher dimensional accuracy, better process stability, relatively simpler tool design and better suitability to online process control. These technical enhancements coupled with the inherent benefits of the ECM using continuous current make PECMM very attractive for its use as a micromachining process. A recent study using PECMM conducted in our lab can be found here.\n\nFigure 1 Schematic illustration of electrochemical machining of the anode.\n\nPulse electrochemical micromachining (PECMM) is a variation of ECM in which instead of using direct current, a pulsed current is used as the power source for electrochemical micromachining.

Micromachining of glass is essential for several microfluidic components, micro-pumps, micro-accelerometers, micro-reactors, micro-fuel cells and several biomedical devices.\n\nMicro electrochemical discharge machining (micro ECDM) is an emerging nontraditional fabrication method capable of micromachining ceramic materials like glass. In electrochemical discharge machining, when a DC voltage is applied between two electrodes immersed in an electrolyte, electrical discharges happen at a particular voltage (critical voltage) on the smaller electrode (cathode). These discharges along with electrochemical action are responsible for the material removal from the work piece during ECDM. . Poor machinability of glass is a major constraint, especially in high aspect ratio applications of glass in microsystem technology.\n\nMachining accuracy at high depths is severely affected due to overcut and tool wear. UCMAN conducted research in ECDM in which high aspect ratio microtools fabricated in-house have been used for deep microhole drilling on glass using low electrolyte concentration. It produced state of the art hole with highest aspect ratio of 11 with lower overcut and tool wear."

Inherent limitations of conventional processes include thermal defects (which compromise the integrity of the geometry and material properties) and reliance on support structures (which introduce extra cost, labor, and risk of part damage). These issues pose a barrier to commercial adoption, prompting study into alternative approaches of part fabrication by AM. The nontraditional nature of the ECAM process allows for overcoming these challenges during part fabrication.\n\nComparison of ECAM and conventional AM processes (MJ = material jetting, ME = material extrusion, SLA = stereolithography, SLS = selective laser sintering)\nAttributes \tMJ\tME\tSLA\tSLS\tECAM\nAvoid support structures\tSomewhat\tNo\tNo\tSomewhat\tYes\nCan deposit metal parts\tSomewhat\tNo\tNo\tYes\tYes\nAvoids residual stress/thermal effects\tSomewhat\tSomewhat\tNo\tNo\tYes\nAvoids post processing steps\tNo\tSomewhat\tNo\tNo\tYes\nCan achieve resolution\tNo\tNo\tNo\tNo\tYes\nWhat is the working principle behind material addition in ECAM?\n\nFigure 1. Working principle of ECAM\n\nMaterial addition by the ECAM process is achieved using the principle of electrodeposition between an anode and cathode submerged in a metal plating bath. In contrast to processes that deposit over a large area (ie: electroplating or electroforming), the deposit is deliberately localized between a tool of localized geometry (anode) and a flat substrate (cathode). An externally-applied voltage bias drives the ions in solution to migrate to the substrate near the tool, reduce in charge, and form a solid deposit on the substrate. \n\nDifferences between ECAM and other electro deposition processes\nProcess \tProcess makes up the entire part\tCathode is removable after the process \tGeometry can deviate from that of a cathode\tDeposited area can be localized\nElectroplating\tNo\tNo\tNo\tNo\nElectroforming\tYes\tYes\tNo\tNo\nECAM\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\n\nThis entire process occurs at room temperature, which avoids the thermal defects seen in conventional processes. Prior work has shown residual stresses in ECAM-built parts to be several orders of magnitude lower than those found in conventional AM parts.\n\nFigure 2. Study of residual stress control in ECAM\n\nWhat is a voxel in the ECAM process?\n\nA voxel is the 3D unit and fundamental “building block” of parts that are manufactured by ECAM.     The filling-in of a given tool-substrate gap by deposited metal is defined as a voxel, or volumetric pixel. Voxel size and properties are programmatically controlled by the relative position between tool and substrate and applied voltage parameters (ie: amplitude, duty cycle, frequency) in the given solution environment. Properties of interest include material composition, microstructure (ie: porosity), hardness, and yield strength.\n\nFigure 3. Study of porosity control in ECAM\n\nFigure 4. Study of structural control using variable frequencies\n\nFigure 5. Study of hardness and strength control in ECAM parts\n\nFigure 6. Study of composition control of multi-material ECAM parts\n\nExtension of electrodeposition to voxel-by-voxel additive manufacturing\n\nA three-dimensional part printed by ECAM consists of a series of voxels built in a defined programmatic sequence by adjusting the relative tool-substrate position in response to completion of each voxel (detected as a current spike). This programmatic sequence is the tool path that is set up to build the desired computer-generated 3D model. This voxel-by-voxel method of material addition is what enables ECAM to print free-standing parts without reliance on support structures.\n\nFigure 7. Integration of the localized deposition with 3-axis control and current feedback to enable deposition of complex 3D CAD parts\n\nFigure 8. Study of support structureless tool path planning for ECAM\n\nFigure 9. Example of a free-standing structure built in a voxel-by-voxel manner with variable build directions, as opposed to a traditional layer-by-layer manner.\n\nView a timelapse of the deposition.\n\nFigure 10. A showcase of the variety of three-dimensional forms built using ECAM\n\nModeling and simulation studies\n\nUnderlying the brief explanation of voxel build is an extremely complex, localized electrochemical environment. The information an experimenter has access to is limited to single in-process current signal and a post-process view of the deposit. However, this leaves questions as to the nature of what is occurring at the interface during deposition. How do the ions move and redistribute throughout the solution near the deposit? Why do they deposit in a certain manner under certain process parameters? Modeling and simulation, provided they are physically-justified by experimental observation and scientific laws, serve as additional tools to gain insight into these phenomena which are otherwise not possible to observe directly. The scale of simulations has ranged from continuum  level (to understand diffusion behavior in the gap and its effect on the deposit) to atomic level (to gain insight into the atom-by-atom nature of electrodeposition).\n\nFigure 11.

Conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy through repeated occurrence of sparks between the tool and the workpiece immersed in a dielectric medium and separated by a small distance (spark gap) results in the material removal from workpiece as well as tool by melting , evaporation and spalling in some special cases. The material removed is the major source of debris particles. The common dielectric fluids used are kerosene, paraffin, and light hydrocarbon oils. A necessary condition for producing a discharge is the ionization of the dielectric medium and splitting up its molecules into ions and electrons (i.e., formation of plasma). A schematic sketch of EDM and the material removal mechanism are shown in Figure 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nOne of our ongoing research activities in the field of Micro EDM is the study of mechanism of material removal in the process. Theoretical and experimental studies are being conducted to understand the influence of various process parameters for an effective process.\n\nFigure 1: Schematic Diagram of EDM Process\n\nFigure 2: Material Removal Mechanism in EDM Process"

Once narrowly defined as simply the development of new products, innovation is now understood to apply to all aspects of the process responsible for the fabrication of a product. Micro manufacturing, in particular, can be perceived as an innovative off-shoot of the age-old art of manufacturing. Though no formal definition exists, micro manufacturing refers to the set of processes for the creation of structures, devices or systems having dimensions of the order of few microns. Most of the technologies that have been utilized in micro manufacturing, with the notable exception of X-ray micromachining (LIGA), are existing technologies downscaled to produce micro features. At this point in the development of technology, efficient micro systems have the potential to be the economic drivers of the foreseeable future. Further, micro manufacturing is an enabling technology for expediting developments in nano science – it bridges the gap between nano and macro worlds.\n\nWith the shrinking size of devices and components, the ability to manufacture precise and robust micro tools becomes increasingly important. While physical downsizing of an existing technique is a widely pursued subject of research, it is time we look upstream and downstream to expedite more applications for techniques that have been traditionally utilized for purposes other than manufacturing. Numerous challenges exist in this evolving arena of manufacturing."

This includes the formal integration of design decisions from several disciplines including engineering, business, policy, and industrial design.\n\nCurrently, the main research thrust areas address the following:\n\nMultidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) of Automotive Vehicles\n\nAutomotive vehicles are large-scale systems consisting of several subsystems and a wide array of components that require design knowledge spanning multiple engineering disciplines and sub-disciplines. While it is intuitive to think that the optimal design of these interacting subsystems and components translates into optimal system design, this is not always true. Integrated engineering design ensures that automotive vehicles are developed such that their system-level performance is optimal, even if their subsystem or component-level performance is not. We intend to apply MDO theory to facilitate integrated design, with particular emphasis on the novel implementation of decomposition-based MDO strategies and the development of appropriate models to support such strategies. We investigate highly-relevant problem applications such as hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) and plug-in hybrid-electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain design.\n\nCombined Multidisciplinary Design & Control Optimization of Automotive Vehicles\n\nAlthough traditional MDO theory and optimal control theory have been applied to the physical system and control system design of automotive vehicles respectively, there have been limited studies that integrate these two design problems for vehicles in a balanced manner. This is problematic as physical system and control system design are generally dependent on one another. Therefore, combined physical system and control system design, or co-design, becomes necessary. An emerging subfield of MDO research known as multidisciplinary dynamic system design optimization (MDSDO) addresses the co-design problem from a more balanced and multidisciplinary perspective than existing design approaches. We intend to develop, enhance, and apply MDSDO theory in the co-design of HEV and PHEV powertrains as well as autonomous driving and active safety systems for automotive vehicles."

Many times these core disciplines and even their corresponding sub-disciplines have strong tradeoffs among one another, and so it becomes critical that design decisions are made in an integrated manner to account for these interactions.\n\nIn practice, this may be accomplished qualitatively through cross-disciplinary design teams. Although such approaches are both useful and necessary, they are limited since they do not explicitly address the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary interactions in a quantitatively rigorous manner.\n\n\nOur mission is to complement qualitative methods for integrated vehicle design by developing and using novel, quantitative integrated design methods that can facilitate the determination of the best overall vehicle design solutions.\n\nFaculty\nMichael J Alexander-Ramos\n\nAssociate Professor-Educator, CEAS - Mechanical Eng\n\n688 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-6402\n\nalexanmj@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nAssociate Professor-Educator, Mechanical Engineering\nAugust 2023 - Present\nDepartment of Mechanical and Materials Engineering\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nCurrent Members\nThibaut Amoussougbo\n\nM.S.

A robotic system, consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a RGB-D camera, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and a manipulator equipped with a high-precision and close-range 3D scanner, is used to perform automated scanning for acquiring 3D model of an aircraft by following an optimal scanning trajectory computed by using reinforcement learning technique: Monte Carlo Tree Search. The resulting 3D model can be analyzed for identifying widespread defects, such as dents and cracks, on the surface of aircraft fuselage, wings, and other components. Such a solution makes the scanning process much more efficient and of higher quality. Further, the solution also removes the tedious, boring, and sometimes even risky human labor from the scanning work.\n\nMethodology\n\nA two-phase scanning method with using a high-precision indoor positioning system is proposed to meet the requirement of high accuracy for the aircraft scanning. The first phase of scanning is to reconstruct a coarse aircraft model with a consumer-grade RGB-D camera and the second phase of scanning is to reconstruct a precision aircraft model with a high-precision 3D laser scanner based on the coarse model acquired in the first phase.\n\nPublications\nSun, Yufeng, Lin Zhang, and Ou Ma. “Robotics-Assisted 3D Scanning of Aircraft.” AIAA AVIATION 2020 FORUM. 2020."

Furthermore, atomistic simulations have been indispensable tools to develop and test predictive models based on the fundamental understanding of atomic-level processes that underlie materials processes and properties. However, even with the striking advances in computer technology, there still exists a disparity of many orders of magnitude in length and time scales between the behaviors of atoms comprising the materials system and processes of technological interest. In order to overcome the scale disparity problems in length and time, two classes of multiscale methods have been developed. Spatial multiscale methods focus on extending the size of the simulated system. One leading spatial multiscale method is quasicontinuum (QC), developed by Tadmor, where material bodies that have atomic-scale defects or deformation are treated fully atomistically while the other bodies are treated by the continuum approximation within a finite element method (FEM) framework. On the other hand temporal multiscale methods seek to extend the time scales accessible in conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are limited to sub-microseconds. Increasing this short time scale is of vital importance because the mechanisms observed in MD simulations performed at rates several orders of magnitude faster than actual experiments can be completely different, leading to erroneous comparisons. Several methods to extend the MD time scale have also been proposed, including hyperdynamics, the parallel replica method, and temperature-accelerated dynamics. Recently, co-working with Tadmor and Voter, the originator of all three acceleration methods mentioned above, I developed a multiscale method which can extend both length scales and time scales, called hyper-QC? Hyper-QC simultaneously spans multiple length scales and extends the accessible time scale in atomistic simulations. It combines quasicontinuum (QC) and hyperdynamics, two leading spatial and temporal multiscale methods within a single framework. QC extends the system size by retaining atomic resolution only in regions of interest and adopting a continuum finite element method (FEM) approximation elsewhere, while hyperdynamics accelerates time in atomistic simulations using ideas from statistical mechanics.\n\nInvestigating Atomic-Scale Friction\n\nDespite a long history of investigation dating back to the time of Leonardo da Vinci, friction remains poorly understood. In particular the fundamental understanding of friction based on atomistic processes is a significant challenge. In recent years, friction on a micro/nano scale has been a growing concern as nanotechnology, particularly nano/micro-electromechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS), advances. In MEMS development, preventing wear and adhesion is one of the most critical issues. At present it is possible to measure the friction force acting on a single-asperity contact at the nanometer scale due to the invention of AFM. One interesting and promising phenomenon which has been observed in recent AFM experiments is superlubricity, dry sliding with ultra-low kinetic friction. Moreover, it has been shown that many systems investigated by AFM exhibit the dependence of friction force on temperature and sliding velocity, which is negligible in macroscopic systems in general. Friction and wear of biomaterials are also investigated by AFM. The key challenge lying in the friction simulation is to reduce the sliding velocities. Although in recent years attempts have been made to reduce the time scales using accelerated MD schemes, all these fully atomistic MD simulations have modeled only the apex of the AFM tip and the near-surface region. The hyper-QC method will make it possible to simulate more realistic systems at the sliding velocities close to the experimental values. Specifically I plan to model AFM experiments to investigate (1) velocity and temperature-dependent friction, and (2) nanoscale wear. First, investigating the physical origin of the dependence of atomic-scale friction force on sliding velocity and temperature, which has been the subject of many recent AFM experiments, will provide the opportunity to broaden our fundamental understanding of friction. Moreover, nanoscale wear is of technological importance because MEMS devices with sliding interfaces have short lifetimes due to excessive wear. Many AFM experiments have revealed that Archard's wear law, which states that the wear volume is proportional to the normal force and the sliding distance, but independent of the sliding velocity, does not apply to wear at the nanometer scale. Instead, wear models in this regime can be based on thermally-activated processes within the framework of transition state theory. Thus, the hyper-QC method, which is designed to accelerate thermally-activated processes, is ideally suited for the study of nanoscale wear. The short-term goals of this study are to establish the explicit relationship between wear volume and controlling parameters such as normal force, temperature, sliding distance, and sliding velocity and to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms. The more challenging goal is to discover mechanisms to reduce the nanoscale wear so as to substantially increase the lifetime of MEMS devices.\n\nNovel 2D materials\n\nGraphene is a promising 2D material for its excellent physical, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties. Moreover, because of its low resistance to sliding friction originating from weak intra-planar bonding, graphene can be used as an ideal lubricant for both macroscopic systems and small-length scale devices such as NEMS/MEMS. Recently, interests in other 2D materials such as h-BN (hexagonal boron nitride), MoS2 are also rapidly increasing. In this project we propose to study the properties of a novel material system consisting of graphene and h-BN using accelerated molecular dynamics methodology, in particular hyperdynamics, which can extend the time scales of conventional MD methods by several orders of magnitude. In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) Investigation of the dependence of friction/wear on temperature, sliding velocity and loading Force; (2) Investigation of the dependence on commensurate/incommensurate interfaces between graphene and h-BN; (3) Investigation of the effects of crystalline defects such as vacancy, dislocation, multi-grain, etc.; (4) Investigation of particular stacking, (i) simple hexagonal (A-A), (ii) Bernal stacking (A-B), and (iii) rhombohedral stacking (A-B-C).\n\nCrystalline Defects and Deformation\n\nAs the size of mechanical systems of technological interest decreases, e.g. MEMS, a detailed knowledge and thorough understanding of underlying atomic scale deformation/failure mechanisms of materials on small length scales have become indispensable to the design of such systems. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of defect formation in crystalline materials such as dislocation nucleation still remains unclear, in particular on small length scales. Nanoindentation is the small-length scale counterpart to the conventional indentation test on macroscopic length scales used to measure hardness. Although the plastic deformation observed in macroscopic indentation tests is well-understood, the deformation mechanisms in nanoindentation tests are an ongoing area of research. Nanoindentation has been widely investigated using fully-atomistic schemes such as MD. However, due to the short time scale problem, most MD simulations are performed at indentation rates that are many orders of magnitude faster than those used in actual experiments. Hyper-QC enables the simulation at the indentation rates up to three orders of magnitude lower than that of the conventional MD scheme."

Most conventional fully-atomistic methods like molecular dynamics (MD) suffer from the great difference in length and time scales between the atomic-scale processes comprising the materials system and the macroscopic real-life processes, and the multiscale methods are the attempts to bridge this gap. \n\nIn particular, to increase the time scales accessible to conventional MD simulation, which are limited to sub-microseconds, I have used hyperdynamics. My current interest in this direction is to devise a novel bias potential for the hyperdynamics simulation that is both computationally inexpensive and robust. In spatial multiscale modeling, I have used the quasicontinuum (QC) method. In particular I have developed \"hyper-QC\" that can simultaneously span both length and time scales by combining hyperdynamics and QC. Hyper-QC enables to simulate larger systems for longer durations than fully-atomistic unaccelerated models and hence has the broadest impact on any sub-field of materials modeling. Among many potential applications, I am particularly interested in simulating atomic force microscope (AFM) experiments to study atomic-scale friction. Atomic-scale friction exhibits very different characteristics from that in macroscopic systems and has been widely investigated as nanotechnology advances. Especially preventing wear and adhesion is one of the most critical issues in the performance and fabrication of micro/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) devices. Friction and wear of biomaterials are also investigated using AFM. My current goal in this direction is to simulate realistic AFM models under experimental conditions using the hyper-QC method.\n\nGrants\nNSF CMMI-1662666: Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Study of the Role of Crystalline Defects in Friction of 2-Dimensional Materials, July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2020 \nNSF CMMI-1463038: Accelerated Large-Scale Simulation Study of Atomic-Scale Wear Using Hyper-QC, July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2018\nFaculty\nWoo Kyun Kim\n\nAssociate Professor, CEAS - Mechanical Eng\n\n497 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-5556\n\nkimwu@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

Once the statistical population is rigorously tested and studied, practical, type-specific global condition assessment procedures can then be developed for the whole group. The UCII researchers have extensively tested and monitored three steel-stringer bridges in Cincinnati and have just contracted with ODOT to test another thirty-four steel-stringer bridges throughout Ohio. Twenty-four of these bridges to be tested will be essentially in good condition but will cover a wide range of structural parameters, including number and length of spans, skew, non/composite design, integral/stub abutment, etc. in order for a more diverse database. The other ten bridges to be tested will be the lowest rated bridges of greatest concern in the state of Ohio."

UCII consists of an integrated, multi-disciplinary team of Civil, Electrical, Computer, Mechanical, and Materials engineers from a broad cross-section of the faculty at the University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering. \n\nIn addition, UCII draws on a wide variety of laboratory and analytic facilities at the University as well as a number of full-scale field research sites located off-campus. Since its inception, UCII has been involved in the testing and evaluation of several structures including more than 60 bridges in the state of Ohio. UCII has developed and applied a number of unique experimental and analytic tools in the evaluation of both laboratory model and full-scale civil infrastructure systems including: modal testing, truckload testing, and field calibrated finite element modeling.\n\nA major thrust of UCII research has been to conduct a comprehensive scientific study of critical bridge responses and their corresponding causative effects (including traffic, the environment, and damage, deterioration, and defects) during fabrication and construction, through in-service use, and up to old age. Such objective, quantitative information and assessments will provide a critical understanding of overall life cycle behavior, performance, and cost of these important links in our transportation system. This understanding will permit more efficient and improved designs for new structures, as well as better management of the large numbers existing structures in our current inventories.\n\nThe work of UCII has been funded and supported by numerous agencies including the Ohio Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, the National Science Foundation, and NASA, and several companies.\n\nFaculty\nArthur J Helmicki\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Electrical and Computer Engineeri\n\n820 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-6069\n\nhelmicaj@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nThe focus of my research and teaching have been in the core area of Systems/Controls, with specialization in the development and application of practical, nondestructive evaluation techniques for damage identification, system identification and parameter estimation, condition assessment,...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

The infrared thermal photographs of the photo-thermal generator with 10 layers of Fe3O4@Cu2-xS films (85% AVT) illuminated by solar simulator (0.4 W⋅cm-2 power density) for different times. The optical photographs show the transparent Fe3O4@Cu2-xS and chlorophyllin films in front of the UC buildings.\n\nA fundamental challenge in energy sustainability is efficient utilization of solar source towards energy-neutral systems. The current solar cell technologies have been most widely employed to achieve this goal, but limited to a single-layer 2D surface. To harvest solar light more efficiently, we have developed a multilayer system capable of harvesting solar light in a cuboid (5 x 5 x 15 cm3) through transparent photothermal thin films of iron oxide and a porphyrin compound (Fig. 1). Analogous to a multilayer capacitor, an array of transparent, spectral selective, photothermal thin films allows white light to penetrate them, not only collecting photon energy in a 3D space, but generating sufficient heat on each layer with significantly increased total surface area. The multilayer system extends another dimensionality in solar harvesting and paves a new path to energy generation for the energy-neutral system. In this fashion, thermal energy is generated via a multilayer photothermal system that functions as an efficient solar collector, energy converter and generator with high energy density. The energy densities inside the cuboid with both types of thin films have reached 1.48×108 J/m3 via multilayers. The solar-activated thermal energy generator in a cuboid can produce heat without any power supply and reach a maximum temperature of 76.1 °C (Fig. 1). With a constant incoming white light (0.4W⋅ cm-2), the thermal energy generated can be amplified twelvefold and increased from 5074.3 J (one layer) to 55, 465.8 J (ten layers) for the Fe3O4@Cu2-xS system, and increased from 3826.3 J (one layer) to 56, 143.9 J (ten layers) for chlorophyllin system, both have more than tenfold of increase. The solar photothermal efficiency (η) of the system is greater than 60 % with 10 layers of transparent films. These experimental results demonstrate a concept of “Thermal Generator” that will show promise in major energy-applications.\n\nSource of Support: NSF CMMI-1635089 and CMMI-1953009\n\nRelated Publications: Solar harvesting through multilayer spectral selective iron oxide and porphyrin transparent thin films for photothermal energy generation, Mengyao Lyu, Jou Lin, John Krupczak, and Donglu Shi, Advanced Sustainable Systems, 2021.\n\nSolar-energy harvesting building skin via transparent thin films with photothermal/photovoltaic dual modality for next generation energy-free civic structures\n\nSmart building skin with PT and PV dual modality\n\nA building skin has been conventionally considered as a weather-resistive barrier without any active functions. This project revolutionizes this traditional concept by structurally transforming the building skin to a versatile energy network capable of harvesting sunlight according to the seasonal changes for energy efficiency. In this new concept, a building skin is considered multifunctionally active for natural energy harvesting, conversion, and utilization. The glass-based high-rise building skins provide ideal transparent substrates for device architecture of energy harvesting nanoscale thin films. A nanostructured thin film on building skin is engineered to offer two major functions: photovoltaic or photothermal, switched alternatively depending on the seasonal needs. In summer, the photovoltaic effect of the coating consumes most of the solar infrared therefore less cooling is required. In winter, the slight increase in skin temperature by the photothermal coating can lead to lowered heat loss from room interior.  The goal of this research is to develop a multifunctional building skin capable of efficient solar harvesting for different energy outputs, be it thermal or electric via dual-modality, spectral selective, seasonably altered. Principally, both photothermal and photovoltaic films share the same optical characteristics: strong UV/NIR absorptions with high visible transmittance, the only difference is the output energy form. The outcomes of the research activities will address the national needs in energy sustainability by entirely transforming the landscape of architectural engineering, civic system design, and energy saving strategy.\n\n\nSource of Support: NSF CMMI – 1953009 ECI-Engineering for Civil Infrastructure\nRelated Publications: Spectral selective and photothermal nano structured thin films for energy efficient windows\n\nJou Lin and Donglu Shi, Photothermal and photovoltaic properties of transparent thin films of porphyrin compounds for energy applications. Applied Physics Reviews, 8, 011302 (2021)\n\nSolar desalination via multilayer transparent photothermal films\n\nSchematic of 3D solar desalination via multilayer transparent photothermal films\n\nIn 3D solar still, sunlight can pass through several transparent panels coated with the photothermal thin films, and generate sufficient heat on each layer for water evaporation. Controlled by valves, seawater is flowing on the surfaces of these panels in a shallow depth and constantly heated by the photothermal coatings on the substrates, resulting in high evaporation rates. Due to multilayers, the total surface area exposed to sunlight is significantly increased, depending upon the total number and size of the multilayers designed. The 3D Solar Still system is entirely relying on natural resources: solar light and seawater, no electrical power is required, therefore environmentally green. The 3D Solar Still can be scaled up to mega sizes in large fields, capable of producing huge quantity of desalinated water for drinking and agricultural irrigation.\n\nRelated Publications: Solar Desalination via Multilayers of Transparent Photothermal Fe3O4@Cu2–xS Thin Films,\n\nMengyao Lyu, Jou Lin, Donglu Shi, Energy Technology, 18 September 2021\n\nPhotothermal coating for optical thermal insulation\n\nSchematic of Chlorophyll-coated “Green Window”.\n\nA new concept of thermal insulation, namely, optical thermal insulation is achieved without any intervention medium such as air or argon, as often used in the conventional glazing technologies. Various transparent, spectral-selective photothermal thin films, based on iron oxide and porphyrin compounds, not only result in sufficient solar light harvest in a wide spectrum, but also allow for efficient conversion of solar light to heat in the non-visible region. If a spectral-selective thin film is applied on a window surface, the skin surface temperature can be increased from 25 °C to > 50 °C via the photothermal effect. This will in turn effectively reduce the thermal energy loss from the interior, based on the so-called optical thermal insulation. Both Fe3O4@Cu2-xS and the porphyrin compounds are found to exhibit strong UV and NIR absorptions, but high visible transmittance. Upon coating the inner surface of the window glass with a photothermal film, under solar irradiation, the window is heated to reduce the temperature difference (see figure), between the single-pane and room interior. The photothermally heated window surface will effectively lower heat transfer through the building skin, therefore achieving the goal of energy saving without double- or triple- glazing. These photothermal materials are abundant in nature and environmentally friendly. The fundamental photothermal mechanisms are identified for both iron oxide and porphyrin compounds in terms of their electronic structures. The novel concept paves a new way for thermal insulation without insulating materials. The engineering implications show great promise in both energy and materials savings for sustainability.\n\n\nSource of Support: NSF CMMI-1635089\nRelated Publications:\n\nOptical thermal insulation via the photothermal effects of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@Cu2−xS thin films for energy-efficient single-pane windows\nLight angle dependence of photothermal properties in oxide and porphyrin thin films for energy-efficient window applications\nProcessing of soft magnetic nano-crystalline powders directly from as-spun Fe77Ni5.5Co5.5Zr7B4Cu ribbon via ball mill without devitrification\n\nHRTEM bright field image and SEAD pattern of the melt-spun Fe77Ni5.5Co5.5Zr7B4Cu ribbon.\n\nA common microstructural feature of the soft magnetic materials is the ferromagnetic nano-crystallites (~10-20 nm) embedded in an amorphous matrix, whose average size is considerably smaller than the correlation length, L, resulting in a unique combination of large magnetization, high permeability, and an extremely low coercive field. The magnetic softness has been explained by the random anisotropy model which predicts that the local magneto-crystalline anisotropy, K, will have a strong dependence of the gran size, D: K ~ (D/L). As shown by several studies, the correlation lengths of Fe-based alloys are between 40-120 nm for grain size well below 20 nm. In the amorphous state, the structure crystalline features are absent (it is structurally highly isotropic), therefore the magneto-crystalline anisotropy will become negligible, resulting in extremely soft magnetic properties. This project is focused on developing the soft magnetic alloys to provide a highly power dense magnetic core with low losses. The research includes rapid solidification, crystallization, and fine powder processing for high-temperature soft magnetic materials. By developing ferromagnetic nano-crystallites (~10 nm) embedded in an amorphous matrix, which are considerably shorter than the correlation length, a soft magnetic material is obtained with superb magnetic properties and extremely low cohesive fields.\n\n\nSource of Support: Ohio Department of Higher Education (CWRU RES511312 sub ODHE)\nRelated Publications:\n\nNanocrystallites via Direct Melt Spinning of Fe77Ni5.5Co5.5Zr7B4Cu for Enhanced Magnetic Softness\nProcessing of Soft Magnetic Fine Powders Directly From As-Spun Partial Crystalline Fe77Ni5.5Co5.5Zr7B4Cu Ribbon via Ball Mill Without Devitrification\nNano-Biomedicine\nDisinfection of COVID-19 Coronavirus via Cold Plasma Treatment\n\nCOVID-19 is known to be transmitted through respiratory droplets that originate from coughs and sneezes of an infected person. Infectious droplets can land on surfaces surrounding an infected individual, including bedding, floors, walls, and objects that may subsequently be contacted by uninfected individuals. Methods to prevent such transmission have been recommended by CDC, including the use of hand sanitizer, alcohol, and a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite. In practice, most of the disinfectants are in liquid or gel forms that may apply directly on skins and hard surfaces. Soft surfaces of clothing, packaging, and everyday mail are, however, not easily disinfected by applying WET disinfectants. It is therefore critical to develop a DRY treatment that can be easily and frequently applied on these everyday items. This research investigates the effect of cold atmospheric plasma on virus disinfection. Plasma is matter in the form of ions and electrons with significant energies, thus viewed as reactive species that can bombard any cell surfaces resulting in significant structural damages. A gas (air, nitrogen, argon, oxygen) can be electrified and charged with freely moving electrons in both the negative and positive state. These plasma radicals can interrupt a biological system at different levels depending upon the power applied and treatment duration to: induce amino acid oxidation; reduce enzyme activity, damage DNA and RNA, and break cell membrane. These effects will all contribute to viral transfection, however to different degrees. By studying the transfection efficiency, we will be able to determine the activity of the virus that has been treated by plasma under given conditions.

The research activities deal with spectral-selective nanomaterials for solar light harvesting, conversion, and energy generation. Fundamental operating mechanisms are the key aspects of the research that correlate the physical properties to the electronic and molecular structures of the new nanomaterials. Transparent, spectral selective, and green thin films are developed based on various porphyrin compounds such as chlorophyll and chlorophyllin. \n\nThese spectral selective thin films are structurally tailored to the desired optical properties with strong UV and NIR absorptions and high visible transmittance.

Gallery \n\nThe development of nano-scaled carriers as a gene and drug delivery platform has made tremendous advances in the fight against cancer.  Despite the progress, drug resistance and metastasis remain major challenges of nanotechnology-based cancer therapeutics.  Our research aims to develop smart nano-scale carriers that can enhance the therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects against recalcitrant drug-resistant and metastatic cancer types.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we use biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric and hybrid materials for targeted and controlled gene and drug delivery.  We employ rational design principles for multi-functional nano-scaled vehicles with active targeting and stimulus-response mechanisms to increase the specificity and efficacy of the delivery systems.  We currently focus on developing nanoparticle-based delivery systems for combination therapy using complementary and synergistic molecules for gene and chemotherapy.  Our current efforts in this area can be found below.\n\nModulation of in vitro phagocytic uptake and immunogenicity potential of modified Herceptin®-conjugated PLGA-PEG nanoparticles for drug delivery\nDelayed

Combustion Sources\n\nAmong many air pollutants in combustion flue gas, our lab studies the reaction and separation of mercury and CO2 gases using catalysis, adsorption, and absorption.  Mercury is a toxic and persistent pollutant that bio-accumulates in the food chain, and most Americans are exposed to mercury primarily by consuming contaminated fish where mercury in the environment is transformed into more toxic methylmercury.  The consumption of methylmercury may cause neurotoxic effects, and children and particularly developing fetuses are especially susceptible to methylmercury effects.  The US EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule requires coal- and oil-fired power plants to use maximum available control technology to reduce the emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.  Among elemental, oxidized, and particulate-bound mercury species present in flue gas, elemental mercury (Hg(0)) is most difficult to control because of its low concentrations, low reactivity with other flue gas components via homogenous oxidation, and low solubility in water.  Therefore, the heterogeneous oxidation of Hg(0) vapor is required for separation of mercury in downstream air pollution control devices.\n\nWe aim to develop high- and low-temperature catalysts that can be used in an existing Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit and downstream after an air preheater in combustion process.  We studied a high-temperature RuO2 catalyst to be used in a SCR unit at 300-400 °C.  When we used rutile TiO2 as a catalyst support, RuO2 formed well dispersed nano-layers, giving higher Hg(0) oxidation activity over anatase TiO2support.  The RuO2/rutile TiO2 catalyst can be used at the tail end section of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit for Hg(0) oxidation.  It showed excellent Hg(0) oxidation performance under sub-bituminous and lignite coal simulated flue gas conditions with low concentration of HCl or HBr gas.  The RuO2/rutile TiO2 catalyst also showed excellent resistance to SO2 under bituminous coal simulated flue gas, maintaining greater than 90% Hg(0) oxidation with ~2,000 ppmv SO2 present.  The oxidized mercury in the form of HgCl2 has a high solubility in water and can be easily be separated in wet flue gas desulfurization scrubbers.  We systematically studied the RuO2/rutile TiO2 catalyst for Hg(0) vapor oxidation in terms of synthesis, reaction mechanisms and kinetics.  Our studies in this area can be found below.\n\nHeterogeneous oxidation of elemental mercury vapor over RuO2/rutile

oxidation over RuO2 catalyst\n\nFull Gallery \n\nComparison between model predictions and experimental data for Hg(0) conversion\n\nWe also study the reaction mechanism and kinetics of a CuCl2-based low-temperature Hg(0) oxidation catalyst for plants without a SCR unit in a temperature window of ~50-200 °C (~120-400 °F).  We found CuCl2 to work as an excellent redox catalyst for heterogeneous Hg(0) oxidation by reducing itself to CuCl and being reoxidized back to CuCl2 with HCl and O2 gases present in typical coal combustion flue gas.  Unlike many metal oxide-based catalysts, CuCl2 also showed excellent resistance to SO2 for Hg(0) vapor oxidation.  We conducted a mechanistic study for Hg(0) oxidation with CuCl2/g-Al2O3 catalyst with high surface area.   We found that CuCl2 formed agglomerates with an increase in temperature leading to sintering effect.  Our reaction kinetic study using unsteady-state grain model showed that CuCl2 could enhance Hg(0) oxidation by lowering the activation energy barrier with the reduction of Cu(2+) to Cu(1+) and supplying thermally stable surface Cl sites following a Mars-Maessen mechanism.  Our studies in this area can be found below. \n\nOxidation of elemental mercury vapor over γ-Al2O3 supported CuCl2 catalyst for mercury emissions control\nHeterogeneous catalytic reaction of elemental mercury vapor over cupric chloride

develops adsorbents for gas separation in energy and environmental applications.  We found that CuCl2-impregnated activated carbon (AC) sorbent captures Hg(0) by oxidizing it to mercuric chloride (HgCl2) followed by physical adsorption.  Therefore, we studied mercuric chloride (HgCl2) adsorption onto activated carbon (AC) sorbent by separating the physical adsorption part to determine the adsorption kinetics.  Based on the adsorption kinetics, we formulated a comprehensive model to predict HgCl2removal in the ductwork and fabric filter by AC sorbent injection.  We also studied various factors that could impact the adsorption performance and sorbent utilization, including inlet HgCl2 concentration, sorbent loading, particle size, external and pore diffusional mass-transfer resistances, residence time, filtration time, injection mode, and pressure drop.  Throughout our adsorption kinetic and modeling study, we demonstrated that for the removal in fabric filter, a discontinuous sorbent injection mode delivering the same amount of sorbent in 10% of a cleaning cycle resulted in higher removal performance and sorbent utilization.  However, at the end of the cleaning cycle, most of the sorbent capacity was not used (< 0.2%).  The pressure drop across the filter cake built by fly ash and sorbent was found to be manageable within typical operating limits.  Our studies in this area can be found below.\n\nAdsorption kinetic and equilibrium study for removal of mercuric chloride by CuCl2-impregnated activated carbon sorbent\nXAFS characterization of

the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, CO2(aq) + HCO3-) concentration high for enhanced CO2 gas absorption and high microalgal growth kinetics.  We study the intracellular mass transfer of dissolved inorganic carbon species under high dissolved inorganic carbon flux to understand the mass transfer and photosynthesis of inorganic carbon species.  We also made a modeling effort to describe the growth kinetics of microalgae coupled with the effects of photolimitation and photoinhibition.  Our studies in this area can be found below.\n\nA Model for Autotrophic Growth of Chlorella Vulgaris

in order to increase the output of a device, pairs of n-type and p-type thermoelectric materials must be added to the module, creating extra electrical connections and resistive losses.\n\n\nTransverse Thermoelectric Energy Conversion\n\nWhen the temperature gradient and electrical current are geometrically separated, such as in the transverse geometry shown in the figure below, the output actually scales extrinsically with the size of the device (meaning that to grow the output voltage, the material would simply need to be lengthened in that direction).  Additionally, the need for both n-type and p-type thermoelectric materials is eliminated since the voltage output can be measured in an isothermal plane due to the orthogonality in the directions of the applied temperature gradient and output voltage.\n\n\nDespite these device advantages, the transverse geometry does need an extra force to push charge carrier movement perpendicular to the temperature gradient, which is found in the Lorentz force.  The cross product between an externally applied magnetic field, Happ||z, and a perpendicular temperature gradient results in a force driving electron movement in the third perpendicular direction, resulting in a voltage output mutually orthogonal to both the applied temperature gradient and external magnetic field.\n\n\nIn the longitudinal geometry, both holes and electrons move in the same direction (condensing on the cold side).  But in the transverse geometry, the magnetic field causes electrons and holes to scatter in opposite directions, where electrons accumulate on one side of the material and holes accumulate on the other.  This lends two-carrier systems, such as semimetals, to be strong candidates for thermoelectric transport in this geometry.\n\nTopological Semimetals\n\nWeyl semimetals were not experimentally discovered until 2015 in TaAs.  This discovery has opened doors for studying unique states of matter in solid-state systems.  Weyl semimetals offer unique signatures depicted in the band structure figure below: linear Dirac bands near their crossing points (shown by dashed yellow lines), crossing points called Weyl nodes that always come in pairs due to the breaking of inversion symmetry or time-reversal symmetry (shown inside the blue circles), opposite chirality at the Weyl points (indicated by the blue positive and negative signs), and sources/sinks of Berry curvature at said Weyl points (indicated by the arrows depicting the directionality of the wave function enforced by the conduction and valence bands respectively).\n\nTopological semimetals specifically are expected to demonstrate strong thermoelectric transport in the transverse geometry due to the access to both holes and electrons and their ultra-high mobility.  Their other unique signatures found in their band structure are also expected to contribute to transport in novel ways.\n\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nResearch in the Energy Conversion Materials Laboratory is motivated by the principles of thermoelectric transport and its potential applications in novel systems.  Here, we seek to answer the following questions (this is not an exhaustive list):\n\nAre all topological materials effective at transverse thermoelectric transport?\nCan a Berry curvature, or other intrinsic magnetic structure, replace the need for an external magnetic field in a transverse geometry?\nWhat and how do other unique transport signatures in topological materials contribute to thermoelectric transport?\nCan simpler, more consumer-friendly materials be developed to exhibit similar transport signature as topological materials?\nCan charge transport and thermal transport be independently separated in a way to increase the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of a material?"

Aside from the everyday tasks an autonomous system can do, extraordinary circumstances are improved too—like a robot that can fill up a satellite with a tank of gas. \n\nBig commercial satellites are costly.

This approach is based on the observation that in provenance model for queries with unsafe negation, why-not questions can be translated into why questions and vice versa. Furthermore, typically only a part of the provenance, which we call explanation, is actually relevant for answering the user’s question about the existence or absence of a result. We have developed an approach that tries to restrict provenance capture to what is relevant to explain the outcome of interest specified by the user.\n\nApProveS (Approximate Provenance Summary)\n\nWhile the size of provenance (even in explanations in PUG) may still overwhelm users with too much information and waste computational resources. In particular for why-not provenance, where the provenance explains all failed ways of how a result could have been derived using the rules of a query, it may be too large to be computed even for small datasets. We address the computational and usability challenges of large provenance by creating summaries based on structural commonalities that exist in the data. Importantly, our approach computes summaries based on a sample of the provenance only and, thus, avoids the computationally infeasible step of generating the full why-not provenance for a user question.\n\nWhy-Not Provenance for Nested Data\n\nThe need to explain missing answers is prevalent in many applications including debugging complex analytical queries. Such complex analytics are often implemented using data-intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems such as Apache Spark which employ nested data models. Hence, there is a need for missing answer techniques for nested data models and implementations of such techniques in DISC systems. In this project, we focus on query-based explanations which assume that the input data is sufficient for producing the missing result and consequently identify which parts of the input query caused the result to be missing. This project is collaborative work with University of Stuttgart.\n\nDatabase Security\n\nRecently, the demand for open data has been increased for transparency. Privacy concerns reside within the information exchange over network and storing and processing the data. In this project, we investigate how to efficiently evaluate the risk in data sharing before opening the data. We study several theoretical models for disclosure risk and information loss to quantify the risk over data linkage. Furthermore, we develop a practical solution for the risk evaluation using sample and summary of data. This is a collaborative work with University of Notre Dame."

This project focused on reconstructing images from video of scenes occluded by thick smoke and developed a method for filtering out the smoke occlusions in fire image streams using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The method works by extracting frames from the video. It is assumed that the images are taken from camera with static background and moving smoke. Using POD, the modes corresponding to the dynamic part of the image sequence representing the smoke are identified and then filtered out to obtain a clear background. The smoke removal technique thus restores the original background that contains the fire information. The technique is applied to a number of sample videos and it is demonstrated that the smoke is sufficiently removed from the video with the background information intact. Following figure shows a sample of original and filtered image obtained from a laboratory experiment\n\n\nEstimation of Spatio-Temporal Processes via Online Filtering\n\nWildfire growth is typically modeled using a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that can be solved using grid-based finite difference or finite element methods using some boundary and initial conditions. Given the geographical spread of the environment over which such events occur and with the temporal aspect factored in, data from sensing systems for such processes are very high dimensional in nature, and thus developing a filtering mechanism that incorporates sensing data for online and real-time estimation and prediction for applications can be very challenging due to the computational complexity involved. In this project, we developed a Kalman filtering based method harnessing concepts in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for dimensional reduction. The rationale behind the proposed approach is that methods such as the POD facilitate reduced-order modeling, thus reducing the computational complexity. Implemented in a grid-based model of the environment, the approach can eventually be integrated into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for effective utilization of information and decision making for incident managers. Following figure shows some results and demonstrates the effectiveness in removing noise in measurements.\n\n\nControl of Distributed Systems and Swarm Robotics\n\nControl of a large number of distributed systems provides several technical challenges which includes scalability of control and information processing algorithms, stability, and robustness to not only sensor/actuator noises but also to broken/delayed communication. The research conducted in CDS Lab is at the intersection of a number of multidisciplinary aspects (as shown in the figure) including:\n\nSystems and controls: Development of decentralized control algorithms, optimization methods, and novel mathematical tools to analyze the stability of system and its robustness to noise and uncertainties.\nProbability and Statistics: Development of tools to represent uncertainties and for their analysis, specifically in a networked environment.\nSelf-organizing behaviors: Drawing inspirations from systems seen in nature at microscopic levels such cellular behaviors to that seen at macroscopic levels such flock of birds, swarm of ants, and schools of fish.\n\nResearchers at the CDS lab have been extensively involved in various aspects of research on multi-robot cooperative control including work on aggregation/segregation of heterogeneous units in robotic swarms, development of control laws for a robotic swarm emulating ant foraging behavior, noise induced adaptive emergent behaviors in swarm robotic systems, and performance driven decentralized control of robotic agents. Some of current focus of research in CDS Lab include: study of statistical-mechanical concepts such random graphs, random geometric graphs, and mean-field theory to model and analyze system behaviors; and study of the effect of noise on robust self-organization of robotic swarms.\n\nSwarming Of Heterogeneous Robots\n\nIt is often difficult to obtain precise information about the states of large-scale systems due to non-linearities involved, complex interactions, and uncertainties. It may, however, be possible to analytically obtain average quantities that would provide crude representations of complex behaviors. For example, in a study on segregation of heterogeneous units in a swarm of robotics agents, average distances between agents of similar and dis-similar types were used to obtain analytical results on segregation of heterogeneous agents under very simple control laws based on differential potential.\n\n\nSpatiotemporal chemotactic model for ant foraging\n\nA significant challenge in swarm robotics is the design and control of a robotic swarm capable of adaptive behavior dictated by local communication in uncertain environments. Given their remarkable propensity to adapt to rapidly changing environments, the dynamics of biological systems, such as an ant colony system, provide fundamental insights in this context. This research focused on development of a new mathematical model, represented by coupled Partial Differential Equations inspired by Keller Segel model of bacterial chemotaxis, for ant foraging that accounts for different behaviors exhibited by foragers in search of food and food carrying ants. The model essentially shows the evolution of i) food searching (foraging) ants; ii) food carrying ants; and iii) the pheromone distribution in the space. Food search is governed by an environmental potential, the pheromone gradient and is also characterized by inherent randomness that allows for a comprehensive search of the entire domain for food sources. Moreover, a fraction of the foraging ants change character to food carrying ants within a certain neighborhood of the food sources and the reverse happens within a neighborhood of the nest.\n\n\nCyclic Pursuit by Multiple UAVs for Monitoring\n\nThis project focused on developing cooperative control laws for cyclic pursuit of robotic agents to track a closed perimeter. In this work, a linear interaction law is proposed for pursuit with UAV. Using principles of linear control theory, stability conditions were obtained and it was shown that, within specified stability regions, the system was robust to addition or deletion of agents. Similarly, cooperative control algorithms for wildfire monitoring and fighting using non-linear interaction potential is also developed.\n\n\nRole of Noise in Robust Self-Organizing Behaviors\n\nOn a research studying the effect of randomness on robust flocking behaviors in multi-robotic agent systems, we were able to show that single-cluster flock would asymptotically form if designed randomness is introduced in the system. It was concluded via analysis as well as extensive simulations that randomness provided a necessary mechanism for robust flocking behavior.\n\n\nSUAVE\n\nThe objective of this project is to design and build a fully autonomous quad-rotor called Smart Unmanned Aerial for Exploration (SUAVE) which will be used to participate in the Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Competition at the 2014 Ohio UAS Conference to be held in Dayton, Ohio from Aug. 26-28, 2014. The project will utilize 3D Robotics airframe and off-the-shelf sensors, wireless communication devices, motors, micro-controllers, and some specialized sensors such as laser scanner. The project will involve integrating all the components, designing fixtures for specialized components, designing software interfaces for different sensor and communication devices with the onboard and off-board computers, developing localization and navigation algorithms for indoor environments, and finally extensively testing the system in the laboratory environment.\n\n\nMulti-UAV Task Allocation via Distributed Optimization\n\nComplex networked systems represent several key engineering infrastructures in our modern society including power grids, wireless networks, communication and transportation networks, world-wide web, and cloud computing networks. In this context, of particular interest is the determination of optimal operation point of these networks to ensure their efficiency/performance, robustness to uncertainties, and responsiveness to dynamic changes. There are several unique challenges to solving the optimization problems in these large-scale networks, such as high-dimensionality due to the NP-Hard nature of many of such problems and lack of global information which traditional centralized optimization methods fails to handle. To address the challenges of high-dimensionality and lack of global information, recent years have seen the emergence of the concept of decentralized or distributed optimization. However, solving the global optimization problem in a distributed and asynchronous fashion using local, and often incomplete and noisy, information in presence of local and global constraints is still an open problem in literature.\n\n\nThis research direction concerns development and application of novel distributed optimization methods for large-scale networked systems. One of the main focuses of this research is to develop a theoretical foundation for carrying out optimization in a distributed framework using only local information specifically focusing on issues of high-dimensionality, non-convexity, slow convergence, and adaptability to dynamic changes for the large-scale networked systems.\n\n\nPrevious research in this area included development of Newton based primal-dual interior point distributed optimization methods for Network Utility Maximization problem in the networks, and application of Market-Based methods for optimal power flow in power grids and resource allocation in cloud computing systems.\n\nAutonomous Navigation in Unknown Environments\n\nIn this work the features of the robot environment such as lane markers and obstacles are divided in to two classes using k-NN algorithm and a maximum margin hyperplane is obtained using SVM that optimally divides both the classes. This hyperplane represents a collision free path. In situations that demand both lane compliance and obstacle avoidance, the use of this technique would simplify the problem and eliminate any conflicts that may arise due to the usage of separate algorithms.\n\nMobile robot navigation in hilly and uneven terrain is a challenging problem. However, humans possess an uncanny knack to identify paths even in difficult terrains. Therefore, it is beneficial to use this human expert knowledge in identifying paths from start to goal. These paths can be considered as additional information to the robot to help them move towards the goal. Objective of this research was to develop a framework where the 1) Robot can make use of human expert knowledge to easily reach the goal from any start position; and 2) The robot can autonomously navigate through the terrains even in the absence of expert assistance. This research made use of reinforcement learning techniques to learn from human experts who provided rough trajectories as inputs. Fuzzy logic was further used to obtain detailed trajectory which was safe for the robot.\n\nExoskeleton for Sit-to-Stand (STS) Transition Support\n\nDevelopment of an exoskeleton for sit-to-stand (STS) transition support based on multimodal action intent recognition\n\n1.5 million Senior citizens live under supervision and most require assistance with at least one or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL), including transferring in and out of chairs, beds and toilets which requires the ability to perform sit-to-stand transition. This sit-to-stand transition is a complex full-body activity that requires the synergistic coordination of the upper and lower limbs and trunk. The goal of this research is to come up with a working prototype of an active, assistive exoskeleton which can be controlled based on behavioral models of user’s intent. The research plan includes synchronized multimodal data-collection of sit-to-stand transitions across various environmental situations and action intent contexts and development of intelligent control algorithms to actuate and operate the exoskeleton. This work can be expanded to control robots in any environment which requires human-robot coordination to complete the same task."

The major advantage of designing of such systems is that the overall system would possess qualities such as performance, adaptability, and robustness to uncertainties and failures that will far exceed the achievable qualities of individual subsystems.\n\nWhile, the technological framework to develop such cooperative distributed systems has been facilitated by advances in communication, computation, and sensing, these systems have been developed in an ad-hoc manner. A systematic design of these systems has huge potential in terms of enhancement of their performance and efficiency. Realizing a control framework of such complex systems presents considerable challenges in terms of modeling and predicting the behavior of such systems, processing vast amount of information, and obtaining control laws which are scalable.\n\n\nPeople in the CDS lab are engaged in developing new decentralized control and information processing algorithms at the intersection of:\n\nControl theory\nProbability theory\nEstimation theory\nStatistical mechanics\nMathematical biology.\nLocation\n\n414 Old Chemistry Building, University of Cincinnati\n2600 Clifton Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45220\nPhone: (513)556-6297\n\nFaculty\nManish Kumar\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Mechanical Eng\n\n629 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-5311\n\nkumarmu@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nCooperative Distributed Systems Lab\nUAV MASTER Lab\nDr. Manish Kumar directs Cooperative Distributed Systems...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nStudents\nMohammadreza Radmanesh\n\nradmanma@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nUser not found User not found\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nSiddharth Sridhar\n\nsridhasd@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nUser not found User not found\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nRumit Kumar\n\nkumarrt@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nSuyash Moreshwar Moreshwar Kulkarni\n\nkulkarsy@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nUser not found User not found\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nShraddha Deepak Barawkar\n\nbarawksd@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nAmanda Mary Miller\n\nmille5am@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nMatthew John Dechering\n\ndechermj@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nAbhishek Venkiteshwara Pai\n\npaiav@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nArshi Mohini\n\nmohiniai@mail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nAlumni\nMohammad Sarim\n\nAutonomous Driving Algorithm Engineer - Aptiv\n\nPh.D. Candidate, Mechanical Engineering, University of Cincinnati, 2018 M.

It took place in Cincinnati, OH, on September 9-10 of 2019. The main objective of the workshop was to bring together a diverse group of experts representing different stakeholder groups and institutions, all of whom had interest in urban sustainability. This document provides a report of discussions that took place during the workshop, along with a set of recommendations for future research.\n\nIntroduction\n\nModern cities are challenged by climate change, growing population, shrinking and polluted natural systems (e.g. streams, wetlands), and rapidly ageing and outdated infrastructure. These challenges manifest themselves in a wide range of problems from flash flooding to frequent power failures and public health issues due to lack of clean water for drinking and recreation. Such events expose the fault lines of urban infrastructure management. Perhaps more importantly, they also reveal the complex and interconnected nature of engineered, natural and social systems that form the fabric of modern cities.\n\nThese systems can be conceptualized as a network of networks, or Urban Multiplex, whose subsystems include the power grid and transportation network, surface water and groundwater, sewerage and drinking water systems, inland navigation and dams, intertwined with the socioeconomic and public health sectors. Yet, traditional urban infrastructure management approaches deconstruct this complex system along specific business and political lines, and manage its components separately, often as if they were not related. The traditional modus operandi remains in place because urban infrastructure development and management is overseen by a multitude of organizations and facilities that operate largely independently from one another to meet their own requirements, and often have conflicting interests. The result is cascading failures across the Urban Multiplex, with catastrophic impacts on human and environmental health. \n\nObjectives\n\nThe objective of the proposed workshop was to convene multi-disciplinary experts from utilities, private industry, academia, non-profits, and federal transportation, environmental and public health authorities to systematically address the interconnections between sub-systems of the Urban Multiplex and to identify potential pathways for cascading catastrophic failures and their impacts beyond infrastructure. The participants worked to advance a clearer understanding of complexity of the Urban Multiplex, and to develop a vision and a roadmap towards its sustainable management for improved environmental sustainability and human health. \n\nStructure\n\nThe workshop consisted of a series of presentations followed by general and breakout group discussions on three main topics: (1) monitoring and data interoperability; (2) analysis and modeling for management and operations control; (3) synthesis towards complexity. The fourth session was dedicated to outlining recommendations for future research. The structure of this report reflects that of the workshop. \n\nOutcomes\n\nThe group has made several recommendations for future research:\n\nUrban infrastructure should be treated as a complex system of systems\nThere is a need to address urban sustainability problems over different time scales, from real-time to long term planning, to support interconnected infrastructures that serve urban systems\nAny analytical capabilities for urban sustainability should be intertwined with continuously streaming data to allow for flexibility and on-the-fly control. Detailed city simulations should be developed and used to explore a variety of resilience adoption strategies \nHuman and institutional dimensions in urban areas should be better understood, including feedback loops across the urban multiplex\nTechnological solutions to urban sustainability challenges should be balanced with potential impacts to different communities\nThe socio-economic, as well as environmental, impacts of green technologies should be better understood\nSession 1. Monitoring and Data Interoperability\n\nThis session showcased a series of presentations and discussions of existing datasets and standards pertaining to urban infrastructure and urban public health indicators. The presentations were multi-sectoral in nature, addressing water issues, public health, and traffic. Each of these sectors could benefit from data from the other; e.g., public health is a function of traffic (air quality) and water quality.\n\nFrom the discipline specific presentations, breakout discussions identified some common themes across the distinct urban sectors. The highlights include the following:\n\nData should be thought of as part of our infrastructure much like highways, as many human decisions in the urban multiplex are driven by data, e.g. travel routes, mass transit delays, drinking water-quality reporting by utilities, etc. We have most of the cyber infrastructure we need, but interoperability is not there yet. There also may be a need to develop the expectation that users pay for data, just as we pay for many other urban services, but the value of data must be clearly articulated to data users and the broader community that supports data infrastructure. Communication of available data resources should be broad and include those beyond the typical user community. Such communication could lead to innovative applications of existing data.\n\nStandardization of data across sectors seems to be an insurmountable and unnecessary task. Current cyberinfrastructure seems adequate for integrating data across sectors as long as those data are (1) accessible and (2) contain necessary metadata to describe the data and methods used to create the data. Workflows for data manipulation should be documented and reproducible.\n\nMaintaining continuity of data often is a challenge, especially for data collected as a part of a relatively short-term project. Moreover, political will to fund ongoing data collection often is missing. In addition, maintenance of existing data can be a challenge so that resources need to be available to support data repositories.\n\nThere are known data gaps, and unidentified data gaps within the urban systems. Managers should be prepared to answer questions related to future data needs and to prioritize those needs. As new data-collection efforts are initiated, there is a need to ensure that data are connected across domains so that data are interoperable. In general, the cyberinfrastructure exists to support most foreseeable data collection and sharing.\n\nIn addition to data gaps, all data contain some level of error. Allowable data uncertainty varies across sectors, so acceptable uncertainty needs to be articulated as part of the data system. For example, errors in water quality may be less acceptable than errors in traffic counts, as the implications are much greater. New approaches likely are needed to conduct continuous quality assurance of data; approaches using machine learning show great promise. Ultimately, there is a need to understand the relations between data error and decision-making, both by individuals and urban-system managers. \n\nSession 2. Analysis and Modeling for Management and Operations Control\n\nThis session was dedicated to discussions of analytical capabilities across urban infrastructure in prevention of system failures. Overall, the participants agreed that the analytics is intertwined with data, tools and operations. Urban infrastructure is a complex system, and we need data to understand its workings. One example is the system developed by the Greater Cincinnati Municipal Sewer District, where over 600 sensors are placed throughout the Cincinnati/Hamilton county sewershed. A control system is in place to manipulate the valves and pumps throughout the system based on observational data. The control system is most effective in reducing the overflow of sewage from the combined stormwater-sewer system into waterways.\n\nCoupled with the sewer system is the Cincinnati flood control system that is placed to prevent the Ohio River from flooding inland. Installing sensors and creating a data collection effort at large scale is expensive. There is room for innovation in terms of optimizing the placement of such sensors and creating partnerships to reduce cost.\n\nIn power systems, monitoring, modeling, simulation, optimization and control are connected. As the grid grows, the interactions and dependencies also grow.\n\nHurricanes and cyber attacks are the largest threat. For example, hurricanes not only cause temporary power outages, but also affect the generation and distribution of power. There is a need to develop out-of-the-box solutions to increase the grid resilience. For example, parked electric vehicles could be used as batteries to power buildings during power outages. Out-of-the-box solutions can also include the best use of available sensors. For example, smart meters in buildings allow 2-way communication so this can be used to manage both the supply and demand side of the equation for energy systems.\n\nAll the sensors are generating a lot of data and there is a need to use these data to analyze and manage the urban infrastructure. Data can give us information about the past and present, but we will need simulation models to understand the future. Considering that the data, especially observations, come from many different resources and sensors, one can think of a system such as the group on earth observations (GEOSS) platform, HELICS and VOLTRON. GEOSS connects users to multiple heterogeneous databases and provides user-friendly information for decision makers. HELICS is a flexible and scalable open-source co-simulation framework that is used for simulating power systems.  VOLTRON is an open-source software platform for connecting data and devices to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.\n\nDuring the discussion, several issues and opportunities were identified in terms of data analytics, modeling capabilities and infrastructure needs. Many times, data are available in aggregated form so it is difficult to use them. Some datasets such as from utilities have privacy issues. Similarly, data from one domain are not easily available to experts in other domains. There may be an opportunity to create a catalog of all available data including the granularity of the data, their sources and ways to access them. Accomplishing this may require standard protocols for data collection, storage and dissemination. This will also require a better understanding of the intertwined nature of a complex urban system so data from one system can be useful in another.\n\nIn terms modeling capabilities, we need to think whether we need a loosely or tightly coupled system, and its pros and cons. There are also many technical considerations including the time and spatial scale, propagation of failure and uncertainties in data and modeling tools.\n\nAccess to data and modeling capabilities also need to incorporate the social dimension. For example, how do these impact low-income individuals? Overall, urban infrastructure including utilities and smart systems are generating unprecedented amounts of data. There is a need to develop tools and capabilities to use these data for proper operation and management of urban systems. It is both an optimization problem (how much to collect data from where?), and a computational problem (how to fast process these data to help make decisions?).\n\nSession 3. Synthesis Towards Complexity\n\nThe presentations in this session focused on the control and management of inter-connected urban infrastructure, as well as lessons learned from natural disasters in terms of both modeling and planning. The presentation by Michael Saffran from the US Army Corps of Engineers highlighted the extensive risk assessment exercise after Hurricane Katrina, including the assessment of the hazard, the infrastructure impacted by it, and the consequences. It found inconsistent and incomplete levels of protection, old infrastructure components, and redundancy. Repairs were slow.\n\nIn the case of City of Cincinnati, Oliver Kroner presented the City’s newly developed sustainability goals and unintended consequences. Among the goals that Cincinnati has been recently pursuing are to decarbonize the energy supplies and to increase energy efficiency. Currently, “green” energy is delivered to 80,000 homes and businesses in Cincinnati. The development of supporting infrastructure (e.g., roads and buildings), however, can also increase flooding due to an increase in impervious surfaces. In the last year Cincinnati experienced three 100-year storms, which resulted in flash flooding and increased landslides. The case of Cincinnati presented a classic example of the complexity of urban multiplex and critical need of sub-system coordination and planning.\n\nThen Steven Bourne from a consulting business, Atkins, shared his experience in city-scale simulations that allow for testing a spectrum of resilience adaption strategies. These simulations hold much promise for characterizing interacting systems within cities such as the economy, people, infrastructure and natural environment.\n\n            The presentations in this session sparked lots of discussions from the workshop participants. Group discussions highlighted the challenges through the processes of proactive planning for resiliency and post-event assessment. Gaps and recommendations were identified in terms of both modeling and communications.\n\nIn order to simulate the urban multiplex in a dynamic environment, some fundamental knowledge gaps need to be addressed first. For example, given the heterogeneities among cities and various levels of institutions/subsystems, better definitions of urban systems need to be developed. Model developers and users need to set proper expectations on the model adoption; i.e., models that are solution-oriented versus those that help researchers better understand and research the system. Planning and policymaking necessitate not only the understanding of individual systems, but also the knowledge of system-level thresholds or inter-system interactions. In addition, models should be able to adapt to and accommodate unknown unknowns. In other words, models need to have the capacity to quantify uncertainties so as to support dynamic learning and adaption. \n\nHuman dimension, as a particularly significant component of urban models, was highlighted in group discussions. Humans and institutions are most important in modeling, but present with the least amount of data and are the hardest to model. In particular, it is challenging to incorporate political processes and governance structure (e.g., central vs. distributed) for a realistic institutional representation in coupled human-natural modeling analyses.  Data are critically needed to help us better understand social attitudes (resistance and acceptance to some urban developments) and connections among economic, political, and economic systems. Verification and validation of the role of humans (i.e., multiple stakeholders and communities) and the government sector in the modeling process are needed. Unique challenges in medium and small cities should be built into future decision-making, especially considering the impacts of poverty on infrastructure development, resource allocation, and social equity.\n\nBesides the computing techniques, effective communications were determined to be the key to advance the value of models. It is particularly important to enhance communication between researchers and stakeholders. Practitioners and stakeholders should be involved early in the proposal development process, as well as throughout project planning and execution. More effective strategies are needed to promote inter-agency communications and stakeholder engagement; there is a high value of collecting and analyzing feedback from various sectors and stakeholders.\n\nIn consideration of social disparities and environmental injustice, multiple methods of communications should be adopted to reach socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Besides models per se, there is a need for better understanding of social resistance and acceptance of new models, new concepts, and new policies. The technology advancement and big data movement have greatly facilitated the researchers’ capability to characterize human behaviors, improve the understanding of social networks, and model complex urban infrastructure systems. Model interpretation and knowledge transfer to both researchers and the general public should be carefully integrated. Communications discussed above can be improved by using emerging social media (e.g., crowdsources), as well as sensing technologies.\n\n            Modeling and analyzing complex urban systems for effective decisions will need to develop system-level metrics that reflect environmental and socio-economic changes, predict and monitor emerging changes at the system level for early warning, identify feedback mechanisms (both institution and technology), and use science-based short- and long-term forecasts for effective system operations and planning.\n\n            Finally, engineers, social and physical scientists, and policy makers tend to address complex urban systems from different angles and usually end up with piecemeal solutions, which lead to inefficiencies in sustainable urban system development. Most professionals are educated in a single discipline and lack the knowledge and skills for communicating across disciplines and for generating broad impacts across sub-systems of a city. Thus education based on interdisciplinary research innovations is needed for the next generation of professionals.\n\nSession 4. Recommendations for Future Research Networks\nGeneral Discussion\n\nThe first round of discussion focused on general questions of sustainability, and participants talked about how they define urban sustainability from their professional point of view. The agreement was that a sustainable city is one that can support happy life from generation to generation within and beyond its boundaries. It requires resources to be available to all residents. A well-funded government, strong banking, green spaces, arts, public health, security and education are all needed for a city to be sustainable. Livability and happiness indices can help capture these aspects of urban life. And while GDP is often used as a measure of prosperity and happiness of a group, there is not a way to get the other pieces of the puzzle like safety or lower income individual help.\n\nRelated to these indices are measures of sustainability that should consider various aspects of the Urban Multiplex. Weak sustainability is economically driven, and balances our current objectives. It is a temporary balance of a few things. We are seeing cities outpacing their locally available resources - an example of people who have temporarily set it up to be successful, but in the long term it is not sustainable - they are vulnerable that the remote resources may no longer be available. On the other hand, strong sustainability will also include environmental and social objectives, as well as sustainability of a larger region that supports city life, making it long-term. Furthermore, at the core meaning of the word sustain is the notion of temporal perspective and change with time. Therefore, static snapshots are only of limited value, and any measure should be dynamic in nature.\n\nThis brings us to the question of data. Quantitative sustainability analysis requires measurements, and that requires ubiquitous sensing. While many cities have embraced sensor networks, we still do not have sufficient data. Sensors themselves could be improved. Even when data exist, there are many associated  challenges, sharing being one of the toughest. For example, utilities collect lots of data, but many are private and are not shared. These issues are solved on a case-by-case basis, and currently there is no common framework for data sharing and exchange. Institutional support is lacking, as well as political will for this kind of activities. As a consequence, technological solutions will not be embraced for as long as there is no political support.\n\nOftentimes technologies are developed by academic researchers, but to be effective - as needed in the case of sustainable urban systems - they have to be adopted by cities. It is advisable to engage with cities early and co-develop technological solutions, or to modify existing technologies to suit city needs.\n\nTechnologies that use streaming data are preferable for flexibility and on-the-fly control of urban infrastructure. Power grid planning is a good example of the critical need of connecting quantitative analysis with rigorous data monitoring and collection. Another example is the sensing and control system developed by the Greater Cincinnati Municipal Sewer District.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe objective of the second round of discussion was to outline recommendations for future research based on needs and gaps identified over the previous two days of presentations and deliberations.\n\nAll participants agreed that urban infrastructure should be treated as a complex system of systems in the nexus of energy, water, transportation, communication, and food. Adoption of this philosophy by the community is a critical part of affecting change - communities must be excited about studies like this, otherwise the results will never be adopted. Engagement starts with the city government (the planning commission in particular), because ultimately they will be the ones using the products that the scientific community will deliver.\n\nFrom technological and scientific viewpoint, there is a need to address problems on different time scales, from real-time to long term planning. Detailed city simulations to explore a variety of resilience adoption strategies could be very helpful in addressing the problem of scales.\n\nParticipants also discussed the need to better understand the human and institutional dimensions in urban areas - including feedbacks among different levels of government (e.g., city, county, state) and different sectors (e.g., power, water, social institutions). How will any recommended management strategies for the Urban Multiplex impact communities? Will these solutions help impoverished groups? What are the forecasts for future demographic shifts under climate change? How will they change the carbon budgets of a city - note that many cities do not have a well-understood carbon budget, or it is not detailed enough to be actionable. Will recommended solutions help create new jobs and opportunities, or lead to new problems? How will they impact public health? What are the current weak links in the urban multiplex and how does this differ among cities?\n\nAs these questions are pondered, we should pay close attention to potential disparity in how technological solutions will impact different communities. Many cities have pockets of concentrated poverty, with as high as 40% of population below poverty level. These neighborhoods have high mortality and unemployment rates, water, environmental and transportation issues. They tend to be in heat islands within cities themselves. So, how do we revitalize these areas in the long-term? Will these solutions change utility costs? In what way? In communities where utility costs are 30% of income, and people are $125 away from homelessness, will these technologies tip them in the positive direction or force them out of their homes? Answers to these questions require high-resolution data, which are not easy to find.\n\nGreen technologies have been used in cities for some time now, but we do not fully understand their impact, and more studies are needed to evaluate it across communities. Are there potential scenarios where installation of green infrastructure would benefit one community and hurt another? How do we use this information to form policy?\n\nNo matter what challenge we set to analyze, we will quickly come to a realization that we cannot solve them one at a time. They are all interconnected, and a multi- and interdisciplinary approach is needed. Taking a systems approach to understanding how cities function - from infrastructure to communities and human behavior - is the only hope of producing technological solutions that will contribute to strong sustainability.\n\nOrganizing Committee\nLilit Yeghiazarian - Chair (University of Cincinnati)\nNing Ai (University of Illinois-Chicago)\nSankar Arumugam (North Carolina State University)\nJerad Bales (CUAHSI)\nXiming Cai (University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign)\nHeather Golden (USEPA)\nVenkatesh Merwade (Purdue University)\nClaire Welty (University of Maryland, Baltimore County)\nSpeakers\nStephen Bourne, Atkins\nJeff Horsburgh, Utah State University\nZhenyu (Henry) Huang, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\nReese Johnson, Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati\nCamille Jones, City of Cincinnati Health Department\nOliver Kroner, City of Cincinnati Office of Environment & Sustainability\nLewis Lehe, University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign\nJeff Oxenham, Cincinnati Stormwater Management Utility\nAnu Ramaswami, Princeton University\nMichael Saffran, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nAll Participants (alphabetically)\nAi, Ning    University of Illinois - Chicago\nArumugam, Sankar    North Carolina State University\nBales, Jerad     Consortium of Universities for Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc\nBourne, Stephen          Atkins\nCai, Ximing     University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign\nDinkins, Sam     Ohio River Sanitation Commission\nGolden, Heather    US Environmental Protection Agency\nHabib, Ayman     Purdue University\nHamilton, Bruce     National Science Foundation\nHarris, Angela     North Carolina State University\nHorsburgh, Jeff     Utah State university\nHuang, Zhenyu (Henry)     Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\nHumphreys, Jeffrey    Duke Energy\nJohnson, Reese     Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati\nJones, Camille     Cincinnati Health Department\nKern, Jordan     North Carolina State University\nKroner, Oliver     City of Cincinnati Office of Environment & Sustainability\nLehe, Lewis     University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign\nMcDonald, Douglas    US Department of Transportation\nMeidani, Hadi     University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign\nMerwade, Venkatesh     Purdue University\nOxenham, Jeff     Cincinnati Stormwater Management Utility\nPaisley, Benjamin    University of Cincinnati\nRamaswami, Anu     Princeton University\nRanjithan, Ranji     North Carolina State University\nRiasi, Sadegh     University of Cincinnati\nSaffran, Michael     US Army Corps of Engineers\nStone, Harry     Ohio River Basin Alliance\nStraus, Katie    University of Cincinnati\nTartakovsky, Alexandre     Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\nUkkusuri, Satish     Purdue University\nWelty, Claire     University of Maryland, Baltimore County\nYeghiazarian, Lilit     University of Cincinnati\nYu, David     Purdue University"

Images of a distributed network of power plants, transmission lines, and end point consumers come to mind. We draw a mental picture of operators in control rooms, monitoring the grid in real time. As we contemplate the electrical grid of the future, we think of it as being smart, with ubiquitous sensors and information flows from producers to consumers and back. We think of it as being green and sustainable, with electricity produced from renewable, nonfossil fuel sources. We even envision a globe‐spanning electrical Supergrid. Similarly, we can think of water systems as a HydroGrid that encompasses surface water and groundwater, natural environment, and built infrastructure. We can draw analogies and learn from the knowledge base of the electrical grid to better understand and sustainably manage the HydroGrid.   \n\nUrban Flooding Open Knowledge Network\n\nThis project seeks to minimize economic and human losses from future urban flooding in the United States. Floods impact a series of interconnected urban systems (referred to in this project as the Urban Multiplex) that include the power grid and transportation networks, surface water and groundwater, sewerage and drinking water systems, inland navigation and dams, and other system, all of which are intertwined with the socioeconomic and public health sectors. We use a convergent approach to integrate these multiple interconnected systems and merges state-of-the-art practices in hydrologic and hydraulic engineering; systems analysis, optimization and control; machine learning, data and computer science; epidemiology; socioeconomics; and transportation and electrical engineering to develop an Urban Flood Open Knowledge Network (UF-OKN). The UF-OKN will empower decision makers and the general public by providing information not just on how much flooding may occur from a future event, but also to show the cascading impact of a flood event on natural and engineered infrastructure of an urban area, so that more effective planning and decision-making can occur.\n\nContaminant fate & transport in complex systems\n\nEven as a waterborne pathogens present significant problems in both developed and developing worlds, their complete eradication is not feasible for technical or economic reasons. Surface waters are particularly vulnerable because they do not have the benefit of natural filtration through soil. As many municipalities worldwide use surface waters as a major source of potable water, their impairment is of significant concern. A modeling strategy that takes into account the inherent randomness of the occurrence and transport of pathogens in surface water is important for accurate risk assessment and prediction of water contamination events. We have developed a stochastic Markov model of microorganism transport, with distinct states of microorganism behavior capturing the microbial partitioning between solid and aqueous phases in runoff and soil surface, including the partitioning among soil particles of various sizes. We are working on extension of this model to different types of biological and chemical contaminants. This model is also a basis for stochastic fate & transport analysis in complex systems such as watersheds.\n\n\nBiosurveillance, biosecurity & decision making tools\n\nOperating in an uncertain environment is one of the biggest challenges in both civil and military settings. The natural environment often serves as a medium for biological and chemical threat regardless of its origin. For threat reduction, we are developing a dynamic multi-scale decision framework based on (1) situational awareness using Geographic Information Systems (GIS); (2) strategic and optimized bio-surveillance leading to establishment of a dynamic observatory; and (3) multi-scale data analysis and predictive models of environmental contamination, exposure and disease outbreaks.  This effort will result in a comprehensive, systems-based decision making resource that could be used to help prevent infectious disease outbreaks due to waterborne pathogens, and to provide rapid response during such events. It will help identify sources of contamination, the origin of pathogens, and predict the scale of ongoing outbreaks.\n\n\nExperimental model parameterization\n\nMany contaminant interact with soil particles as they rest on soil surface or travel in overland flow, therefore there is often clear partitioning of contaminants in soil/water systems. We conduct lab experiments to measure it. This involves studies of contaminant distribution in soil sediments of varying sizes and of contaminant-soil particle aggregate behavior. The measurements are used in inference of fate&transport model parameters.\n\n\nImpact of climate change on water quality\n\nThe extent of water quality alteration due to the changing climate is not easy to measure for two main reasons.  First, monitoring and sample testing to obtain comprehensive data on water quality is difficult; and second, because climate change has an indirect impact on water quality. Rather, it is the complex interplay between soil, land surface and, most of all, hydrological parameters, which determines the contaminant loads and transport in surface and ground waters. We study correlations and spatiotemporal patterns of climate and water quality parameters based on large datasets. \n\nImpact of climate change on water quality\n\nImpact of climate change on water quality\n\nMulti-scale disease progression & transmission\n\nInteractions of HIV with the immune system have been studied experimentally and using mathematical models. Epidemiological studies provided insight into HIV dynamics in human populations. The importance of social network topology in epidemics became apparent as research on structure of technological networks progressed. We have developed a mathematical model that bridges the scales between in-host processes and HIV transmission in human sexual networks. Each individual goes through a sequence of health states reflecting HIV status and treatment. Associated with each state is an in-host model of HIV-immune system interactions. At the same time, each individual is a node in a sexual network. We investigate the effect of a variety of medical care criteria and decisions on both the health state of the individual, and on the spread of disease in populations with different network topologies. This model is currently being extended to describe waterborne disease.\n"

The Callboaratory consists of members of the Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Biomedical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science Programs.\n\nProjects\nDynamic Model of the Middle Ear Ossicular Chain\n\nThis project focused on designing and developing a prototype of middle ear ossicular chain based on the research carried out by Dr. Ravi Samy, Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Pediatric and Adult Otology/Neurotology at the University of Cincinnati Medical School.  Dr. Samy’s research showed the ability to understand the properties and behavior of the different components and tissues of the middle ear ossicular chain.  The engineering team, comprising Mechanical Engineering seniors Brain Kim, Brian Kunes, Matt Schnuth, and Andy Ward under supervision of engineering faculty members, produced this prototype as a Senior Design Project in which they completed an iterative process of design and construction of this twenty times size model.  Testing was performed on the model using a wave generator and a triaxial accelerometer. The results based on this research project was published at 2011 ASME Conference on Frontier in Biomedical Devices and has been well received both within (including publications in College of Engineering Applied Science’s research magazine) and outside the UC’s research community.\n\n\nSuperbug Fuel Cell\n\nThis project was based on the research on genetically altered super-bug  bacteria carried out by Pilus Energy and Dr. Dan Hassett at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.  His research showed the ability of aerobic super-bug bacteria to generate electricity in a controlled environment using organic waste matter.  The overall objective of the research is to be able take all waste water and all sanitation waste from the house and run it through a small version of a tertiary treatment plant-similar to what is used on the Space Station.  The plant would recycle the water for all use except drinking and would produce natural gas from the anaerobic bacteria digestion and electricity from the superbug that Pilus Energy is promoting as part of the fuel cell project.  The superbug would be part of the aerobic processing part of the plant.  \n\nThe purpose of the Senior Design Project was to design and construct two large scale fuel cells to generate electricity from waste water.  The Senior Design Team was composed of Bobby Duncan, Tyler Janzen, Eric Lindhurst and Will Morton, Mechanical Engineering students at the University of Cincinnati.  The team designed and constructed a stainless steel based fuel cell and a crushed graphite based fuel cell.  Both cells were tested with a bacteria growth media and provided excellent voltage results that had not been seen in earlier attempts to prototype the design of such fuel cells.\n\n\nHuman Fall Detection using Vision Sensors\n\nThis is an ongoing project which focuses on developing a non-invasive sensor based fall detection system to address the growing concerns for developing a smart home system for the care of elderly. This work is part of an innovative paradigm of research aimed at a synergistic exploitation of distributed devices via techniques that are at the intersection of data mining, inferencing and learning, and distributed decision making for developing a co-robotics based solution for personalized care for elderly with cognitive impairment. The initial part of this work, involves the implementation of a human motion tracking system for monitoring the activities of one person using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. The human gait information obtained thus would be used to determine fall by matching the gait patterns with that of the patterns associated with the fall. The overall objectives of this work are directed towards realizing the larger goal of developing a robust system for fall detection for the elderly with measures in place against false detections.\n\n\nBrief History\n\nThe Collaboratory for Medical Innovation and Implementation has been launched to achieve excellence in research and education with collaboration between faculty in the College of Medicine (COM), the College of Nursing (CON) and the College of Engineering & Applied Science (CEAS).  The Collaboratory consists of faculty members of the Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Biomedical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science Programs.  The Center for Robotics Research has been conducting design and prototyping projects for COM and CON utilizing its expertise in intelligent control and robotics since 2010.\n\n\nThe Objective of CMII\n\nThe objective of this new initiative is two-fold:\n\n\nWith this new initiative, anyone who is an idea generator can turn a concept into an actual hardware or software solution. For example a COM faculty could provide a description of a need or problem to utilize the expertise of the faculty members and students in the Collaboratory.\nAs a result of this new initiative, CMII will provide a solution in the form of a prototype, with all the necessary hardware and software.  Using the above example, this has the double benefit of not only meeting the need or solving the problem for the COM faculty but also serving as training and hands-on experience for engineering students.\nHow can we work with you?\n\nHighly motivated engineering students with outstanding intellectual capabilities will be selected and mentored by a team of engineering faculty in the Collaboratory.  A typical project will be identified and developed by CMII.  The project will then be assigned to engineering faculty, which will be paired with graduate and undergraduate students based on their background and interest.  These students will work closely with the faculty members to carry out these projects.\n\nExamples of projects can be a design that needs to be prototyped, an idea that needs to be turned into an engineering design, implementation of a software program, or control of a hardware device.  If you have such needs, faculty members at the Collaboratory will work with you to evaluate the project scope, complexity, and duration, identify students suitable for the project, and estimate funding necessary (provided by the project sponsor) for completing the project.\n\nLocations\n\nCollaboratory for Medical Innovation and Implementation (CDS Lab)\n414 Old Chemistry\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nCincinnati, OH 45221\n\nIMAGE Lab\n517a Old Chemistry Building\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nCincinnati, OH 45221\n\nCenter for Robotics Research\n551 Baldwin Hall\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nCincinnati, OH 45221\n\nFaculty\nDaniel Humpert\n\nhumperdl@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nDan Ralescu\n\nProfessor, A&S Mathematical Sciences\n\n4506 French Hall\n\n513-556-4092\n\nralescd@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nPhD  in 1980 from Indiana University (Bloomington)\n1976-77 Assistant Professor, Department of Economics and Management,University of Dijon, France\nJoined University of Cincinnati in 1980\nOn the Editorial Board of 10 professional journals\nFrequent lectures, and plenary...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nJanet Jiaxiang Dong\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Mechanical Eng Tech\n\n494 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-5305\n\ndongjg@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nDr. Janet Jiaxiang Dong is a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and the director of UC Center for Robotics Research at the College of Engineering and Applied Science. \nVIEW FULL PROFILE PERSONAL WEBSITE\nManish Kumar\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Mechanical Eng\n\n629 Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-5311\n\nkumarmu@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nCooperative Distributed Systems Lab\nUAV MASTER Lab\nDr. Manish Kumar directs Cooperative Distributed Systems...\n\nREAD MORE\nVIEW FULL PROFILE\nPhilip A.

Eyewashes are also located in room 354 and 374.\nShorts, smoking, food, drinks, and open toed shoes are prohibited in the ERC clean room.\nNone of the clean room apparel will be worn outside of the ERC clean room.\nGases: \nGas cylinders must be stored in an exhausted gas cabinet or an exhausted fumehood.  A cylinder holder must be used with a chain or belt securing the cylinder in place.\nAll newly installed gas systems must be helium leak checked with a helium leak detector and meet certain leak requirements.\nFlammable gases and oxidizers must be stored in separate cabinets.\nAll gas cylinders and cabinets must be labeled with their contents.\nAcids and Bases\nAcids\nAcetic Acid\nHydrochloric Acid\nHydrofluoric Acid\nNitric Acid\nPhosphoric Acid\nSulfuric Acid\nBases\nAmmonium Hydroxide\nPotassium Hydroxide\nSodium Hydroxide\nPositive Photoresist Developer\nHandling Acids & Bases\nWhen handling acids or bases, gloves, apron, face shield, and lab coat must be worn.\n All acid and base work must be done in an exhausted fumehood to remove the strong irritant or corrosive fumes. Hydrofluoric Acid is lethal if inhaled.\nWhen mixing solutions containing acids or bases, always pour the acid or base into water, NEVER the reverse.  Pour slowly, because violent reactions may occur if mixed incorrectly.  After mixing the acid or base, allow the solution to cool thoroughly.\nNever work with acids and bases side by side because violent reactions can occur.\nThe acid cabinet is located in ERC 355 on the left side of the ERC 354 entrance.  All acids are stored in these cabinets.\nBases are stored in ERC 355 .  All bases are stored in these cabinets.\nStorage of waste acids is done by storing them in a clearly labeled waste container for that particular acid and placed in an acid storage cabinet.  Do not mix the acids together when ever possible.\nStorage of waste bases is done by storing them in a clearly labeled waste container and placed in a base storage cabinet. Ammonium Hydroxide will be stored in a clearly labeled waste container. Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, and positive photo resist developer can be stored together in a clearly labeled waste container.\nAfter use of acids or bases, allow them to cool thoroughly before placing them in a waste container. Pour them slowly into the waste container and cap the bottle tightly.\nDisposal of acids or bases through the drain can occur only after a pH level between 6 and 8 is achieved through neutralization.\nNeutralization of the acids is done by taking approximately equal parts of Sodium Hydroxide solution placed in an open polypropylene container and slowly adding an equal part of acid until a pH between 6 and 8 is reached. Always pour the acid into the Sodium Hydroxide solution.\nBases are neutralized by adding Hydrochloric Acid to the base solution in an open polypropylene container in an exhausted fumehood until a pH between 6 and 8 is reached.  Always pour the acid into the base.\nIf any acids or bases are purchased by individual faculty or students, they must take the responsibility for the neutralization by purchasing the neutralization chemicals and mixing of the chemicals to achieve a pH between 6 and 8 before disposal down the drain with large quantities of running water.\nA material safety data sheet (MSDS) has to be supplied to the Microelectronics Engineer for any chemical brought into the ERC Clean Room for a specific use.  This will be added to the master file.\nDisposal of wastes can also be done through the Safety Department.  A waste label has to be obtained, filled out, and placed on the waste container for the Safety Department to dispose of the waste.\nDanger- Hydroflouric Acid (HF)\nHydrofluoric acid does not produce tissue burns upon contact like most acids.  Hydrofluoric acid looks and feels like water and does not have a strong odor.  If contact is made, hydrofluoric acid will diffuse through the tissue and start to neutralize and dissolve the bone.  All the tissue the HF diffused through will be destroyed and will have to be removed to heal.   Hydrofluoric acid fumes can be fatal.\nSolvents\nWhen handling solvents, gloves, apron, face shield, and lab coat must be worn.\nAll solvent work must be done in an exhausted fumehood to remove the fumes.  Most solvents present some degree of toxic hazard when their fumes are inhaled over prolonged periods.\nOrganic solvents, such as acetone and trichloroethylene, will react with acids or strong oxidizing materials such as hydrogen peroxide.  DO NOT MIX THEM.  A mixture of nitric acid and acetone is highly explosive.\nAvoid contact with solvents.  Solvents are readily absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream.  Some solvents, such as trichloroethylene, are carcinogenic.\nKeep all flames away from the solvents because most solvents are highly flammable.  Though there are few ignition sources in the lab, always be cautious of solvents near any source of a spark.\nPhoto resist contains organic solvents as part of its makeup.  These solvents can be, as hazardous, or more so than the other solvents used in the laboratory.  Avoid skin contact or breathing the fumes of the photo resist.\nSolvents are stored in the metal cabinets in room ERC 355.  All solvents are stored in these cabinets.\nAll waste solvents must be stored in a clearly labeled waste solvent container for proper disposal.\nTrichloroethylene (TCE), Trichloroethane (TCA), and chlorobenzene can be stored in the same chlorinated waste container.  Any solvent with “chloro” in its name should be stored in the chlorinated waste container.  Acetone, Methanol, and Propanol can be stored in the same non-chlorinated waste container.\nOn all solvent waste containers will be a label. On this label will be four columns that need to be filled out when a waste solvent is poured into that bottle.\nWaste container label information\nAdvisor's Name\tChemical Name\tConcentration (%)\tQuantity\nKPR\tbody\tbody\t250 ml\nThe chemical name is the proper chemical names not the manufacturer name.   An example is JT Baker PRS 3000 is the manufacture name, the proper chemical name is N-methyl 2-pyrrolidone. Most solvent containers have the proper chemical names listed on them.\nSolids: Solids must be stored in an appropriate container and clearly labeled for disposal through the safety department.\nRadioactive Materials: Radioactive materials must be checked out through the radiation safety department for proper storage, handling, and disposal and must meet all their requirements.\nSolids\n\nSolids must be stored in an appropriate container and clearly labeled for disposal through the safety department.\n\n\nRadioactive Materials\n\nRadioactive materials must be checked out through the radiation safety department for proper storage, handling, and disposal and must meet all their requirements.\n\nDanger- Mercury Vapors at Room Temperature\nMercury evaporates at room temperature and is highly toxic.  Notify your instructor if you break a thermometer or spill mercury.\nUltraviolet light sources (present in the mask aligner and mask maker) are normally quite safe. However, when these lamps approach their useful life, they can overheat and explode.  This releases toxic mercury fumes into the room.  Should this happen, immediately leave the area and notify your instructor.\nAfter turning off a normal UV lamp, it must cool for 30 minutes before restarting.  Failure to do so may result in a lamp explosion.\nMercury can be picked up with a mercury spill kit and stored in a properly labeled container and disposed of through the safety department.\nGeneral Rules of Operation for the ERC Clean Room\nPersons regarded as qualified to work in the ERC Clean Room are:\nSpecially trained engineers and associate researchers.\nGraduate students working towards a higher degree under the directions of an Electronic Materials and Devices faculty member and has successfully completed either the MEMS fabrication lab (ECECS 641) or the Compound semiconductor fabrication lab (ECECS 697).\nSenior students enrolled in either the MEMS fabrication lab (ECECS 641) or the Compound semiconductor fabrication lab (ECECS 697).\nRules for all persons qualified to work in the ERC Clean Room \nHood, coveralls, and shoe covers must be worn in all clean room areas.  These items are donned and removed in the entrance area.  These garments MUST NOT be worn outside of the ERC Clean Room.  If your smock is missing, a visitors smock can be worn or see the Microelectronics Engineer for another smock.\nGloves and safety glasses must always be worn when using any of the equipment in the ERC Clean Room.\nWhen handling any chemicals, gloves, apron, face shield, and lab coat must be worn.  This work must be done in an exhausted fumehood.  Open containers of chemicals should not be moved from one part of the lab to another, they should stay in the fumehood.\nWhen chemical usage is completed, these chemicals must be stored in a properly labeled container for reuse or a proper waste container and placed in the proper cabinet.  Proper container with a lid.  Plastic wrap or aluminum foil does not constitute as a proper lid.\nDo not leave chemicals unattended. When finished, cleanup the work area and put all items used back where they belong.\nIf a chemical bottle is almost empty, contact the Microelectronics Engineer for a fresh bottle.\nLimit writing materials brought into the lab to a pen and a bound notebook.  These items should never be placed on critically clean areas such as a wet bench.\nWhen using general lab equipment, a user record book is present and MUST BE FILLED IN and any strange occurrences\nmust be recorded.  Any breakage and faulty equipment must be report to the Microelectronics Engineer and recorded in the sign-up book.\nUnder no circumstances can general lab equipment be stripped of parts or removed from the  ERC Clean Room.\nStorage of equipment is limited to several cabinets. A request for storage space can be sought from the Microelectronics Engineer.\nNonessential items of equipment will not be allowed to accumulate in any area of the ERC Clean Room and will be removed at the discretion of the Microelectronics Engineer.  This is what storage cabinets are for.\nUpon completion of a thesis, you must dispose of any chemicals that were purchased for you.  A waste label has to be obtained, filled out, and placed on the waste container for the Safety Department to dispose of the waste.  If the chemical will be used in the future, please make sure the label is in good condition. No headphones or radios.  It is very hard to hear any safety alarm in the lab even without headphones.\nDo not touch other people’s substrates.\nDo not use other peoples’ equipment or supplies without asking them.\nIf you are unsure of something, ASK FIRST.\nIf you observe someone violating any of the safety or general rules or doing something that is unsafe, say something to that person and find the Microelectronics Engineer immediately.  This is for everyone’s safety.\nIndex of Published Advisories\n\nProvided by Environmental Health and Safety\n\nThis is a shortened list of advisories applicable for use in the ERC clean room research facility by faculty staff, students and visitors.\n\nSection\tTitle\n\n\n1.0\n\n\t\n\nEmergency Response (1 page)\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\t\n\nFire/Smoke Emergency Procedures (1 page)\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\t\n\nEvacuations- Persons w/Physical Disabilities (2 pages)\n\n\n\n\n6.0\n\n\t\n\nHazard Communication Standards / Right-to-Know (5 pages)\n\n\n\n\n6.1\n\n\t\n\nOSHA Laboratory Standard: University of Cincinnati Chemical Hygiene Plan (22 pages)\n\n\n\n\n6.2\n\n\t\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati Exposure Control Program (9 pages)\n\n\n\n\n7.0\n\n\t\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati Waste Management Program (1 page)\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n\n\t\n\nWaste Management Responsibilities (1 page)\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1\n\n\t\n\nLaboratory Faculty, Staff, and Student Departure Procedures (3 pages)\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\t\n\nWaste Reduction  (3 pages)\n\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\t\n\nManagement of Chemical Wastes Updated 11/15/2001 (92 pages)\n\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\t\n\nHandling Hazardous Chemicals (15 pages)\n\n\n\n\n8.0\n\n\t\n\nLaboratory Fume Hoods: Operations and Use Considerations (5 pages)\n\n\n\n\n8.2\n\n\t\n\nLaboratory Audits (2 pages)\n\n\n\n\n9.0\n\n\t\n\nElectrical Safety in the Laboratory (8 pages)\n\n\n\n\n11.1\n\n\t\n\nRespiratory Protection Guidelines (11 pages)\n\n\n\n\n12.2\n\n\t\n\nOccupational/Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses (11 pages)\n\n\n\n\n12.6\n\n\t\n\nPrevention of Adverse Health Effects from Exposure to Lead and Materials Containing Lead (5 pages)\n\n\n\n\n14.0\n\n\t\n\nRadiation Safety (2 pages)\n\n\n\n\n15.0\n\n\t\n\nStorage of Flammable & Combustible Liquids (4 pages)\n\nThe ITC is a central point of access for all health and safety training offered to the University community.

The advent of community-wide clouds will only become reality when trust in data and trust in data security reach a tipping point resulting in broad-based adoption of these next generation capabilities.\n\nAltamira is at the heart of this challenge performing ground-breaking R&D and providing mission critical services to aid our country’s cyber defense, to include:\n\nSupport to information operations\nLarge-scale streaming analytics\nAtomic-level security\nAdvanced penetration testing\n\nFuture cyber vision: A community cloud that provides end-to-end security factoring in biometrics, context awareness, trusted concepts and atomic-level policy decisions\n\nAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM), Student Chapter\n\nStudents of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) are on a mission to bring new energy and focus to the UC Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student chapter. ACM is one of the oldest and largest scientific and educational computing societies. As a national organization, ACM sponsors many computing events, such as the International Collegiate Programming Competition, and has sponsored other events like the famous chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM supercomputer \"Deep Blue\". ACM is organized into over 170 local chapters, 35 special interest groups, and over 500 collegiate chapters.\n\nAs an inclusive organization for all computing and technology majors, the chapter strives to bring quality events related to computing to the University and College.  The ACM chapter also serves to provide assistance in any way possible to student members. The organization has held several events, such as a Linux Installfest and the ICPC, Innov8 UC, and are planning more.\n\nEach event and activity is unique in its own way and showcases the mission. For more information: http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/about.\n\nWorld Bank\n\nThe University of Cincinnati is currently partnering with the World Bank's Procurement Office and Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) to fight corruption, collusion, and fraud. In pursuing its mission to promote development and reduce poverty, the World Bank Group strives to ensure that Banks funds are used for their intended purpose.  The Bank Group has charged INT with the responsibility for investigating fraud and corruption in Bank Group-supported operations or activities.  The Bank Group has also charged INT with the responsibility for investigating allegations of potential misconduct against Bank Group staff.  INT assists in preventative efforts to protect Bank Group funds as well as those funds entrusted to the Bank Group from misuse and to deter fraud and corruption in Bank Group-supported operations or activities.\n\nThe Trustworthy Data Engineering Laboratory (TRUST Lab) at the University of Cincinnati is helping to fight corruption, collusion, and fraud by researching and developing new algorithms, methods, and tools to identify and disambiguate large data stores, derive insight through the use of machine learning and data science from these stores, and provide expert systems to aid human investigators in the fight against cybercrime in international procurement."

Team members included one middle school math/STEM teacher, one high school math teacher, a graduate student and a high school senior in addition to the faculty mentor and academic coordinator. The outcomes of this project were:\n\nThe teachers learned much about systems that ensure confidentiality, authentication and message integrity\nThe teachers put together two units and four activities to be used in their STEM classes this coming academic year.\n\nA YouTube video outlining the results of the project can be viewed at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6fvDOI50E1Q\n\nThis project was supported by the National Science Foundation. The project will be extended next year, details to be determined.\n\nAs a result of this project about 60 middle school students will visit the University of Cincinnati in September to attend a talk and demonstration by Jason Armstrong, SEAL for Penn State University, on cryptography. Specifically, Jason will demonstrate the operation of an Engima machine that is on loan from the National Cryptologic Museum, describe crypto puzzles suitable for motivated middle school students, and introduce the codebreaker challenge. Some of the middle school students will actually encode messages on the Enigma machine while others decrypt the messages using a java applet that was developed during the RET project mentioned above.\n\nSummer Camp in Information Technology\n\nChengcheng Li completed the first summer camp of DITLE (Design-based IT Learning Experience) project which is funded by NSF ITEST program (#1433769).  Forty seven students from six local public high schools and pre-service teachers attended the 3-week camp learning essential IT skills. Cybersecurity was a major theme. Five out of the six student teams chose cybersecurity as their research projects during camp. They conducted research with the teachers and advisors. They presented their projects on the last day of the camp to the UC team and their parents. Survey data are under analysis and will be published later this year.\n\n\nCybersecurity Symposium\n\nChengcheng Li and Northern Kentucky University have planned a cybersecurity symposium. Li invited CS, PS, UCIT, and other cybersecurity related UC departments to the discussion. The format and the timeframe of this symposium are as yet undetermined.\n"

In addition to implementing a CLDP, UC Army ROTC is working closely with the College of Engineering, College of Education, Criminal Justice and Human Services, and Department of Political Science to emphasize specific scholarship opportunities for students pursuing cyber-related majors and minors across multiple disciplines; promote the creation of a cross-disciplinary cybersecurity major; and create a student cyber club group at UC – open to the entire student body, not just ROTC cadets – that includes not only computer science and information systems majors, but also include students pursuing education in the political science/international relations policy and administration majors and minors.\n\nThe larger intent of the cybersecurity major and the cyber club is to expose students pursuing traditional and non-traditional cyber-related majors and minors to areas affecting the cyber operations community that they would not normally be exposed based on the engineering or information systems/technologies majors. As part of a pilot program, one of UC Army ROTC top cadets completed an unpaid summer internship this past Summer (2015) with the Ohio Army National Guard (OHARNG) Cyber Protection Team (CPT). In addition to the experiences gained by the cadet, the program confirmed the viability and feasibility of future internships with both with the OHARNG CPT and the regional tri-state Cyber Defense Team between the Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan state national guard forces."

You don't have to attend the University of Cincinnati and you don't have to be a computer science major or engineering student. We're looking for people who share our passion to do awesome things with technology.\n\nProjects are one of the key elements in any hackathon. At RevolutionUC, you have 36 hours to create something awesome from start to finish with your team. We’ve seen awesome mobile apps, web applications, and hardware hacks in the past and we’re excited to see what will be made this spring.\n\nLearning is essential to a hackathon. Whether you’re a veteran hacker or a first-timer, we’re excited for you to learn something new! We’ll have exciting tech talks throughout the event and we encourage all our attendees to learn something new!\nNew to the hackathon scene? Awesome! We’re excited to have you. We’re more than willing to help you get you started with your first hack! With our team of mentors, assembled from our organizer team and software engineers from our sponsors, we’ll help get you started and get you past the bugs and bumps.\n\nHackathons are more than just a competition or showcase of technical skill. At RevolutionUC, we strive to create an all-inclusive community that acts as an outlet in which we can join our peers and share our passion for all the incredible things that can be done through programming. We’re excited to share this ethos with all of our attendees and come together to grow the hacker community here in Cincinnati.\n\nACM Programming Contest\n\nThe Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, in association with the IEEE and ACM student chapters, annually co-host the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) East Central, North American International Collegiate Programming Contest. Teams from Western Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Ontario, Canada compete for a chance to be one of few who advance to the World Finals.\n\nUC is one of four sites who simultaneously hosting the contest. The other sites are Grand Valley State University, Michigan, the University of Windsor, Canada, and Youngstown State, Ohio. UC holds the record for consecutively co-hosting the event since 2000.\n\nWith three people to a team and nearly 120 teams, 360 students are in for a challenging day! The contest consists of a web of complex computer problems that teams must solve. The competition lasts five hours and participants must decipher eight intense problems. Question difficulty ranges from short to very time consuming, to keep the teams on their toes.\n\nTo aid in the problem-solving process, teams must first create and then use a computer program which accepts inputs for the problem, and outputs a value which corresponds to the correct answer. When a team believes they’ve solved a problem, the computer tends sends its program to the judges for examination. The judges respond by indicating either an error or success. In the case of an error, the judges say only what type of error it is, no specific details are given. It is up to the team to successfully “debug” the program.\n\n\nUC will face off against teams from Carnegie Mellon, Purdue, Ohio State, Cedarville, Taylor, University of Dayton, Xavier, Butler, Miami, Denison, Ohio Wesleyan, Ohio Northern, Wittenberg, and Wright State.\n\nTeams are ranked using a complex scoring system, ranking teams in terms of who has the most completed problems. Ties are broken by factoring in the time taken to achieve success and applying penalties for errant submissions. Of the 120 teams, only the two top ranked teams go to the world finals. In past years the winners have hailed from Toronto, Waterloo, and Carnegie Mellon."

It deals with the design, conceptualization, analysis and testing of a robotic device which fits into the drain and cleans it without needing to interfere with the surrounding traffic or the drain itself. The project was an effort to shift the cleaning process for the trench drains from manual to either semi-automated or automated methods. \n\nDue to the previous methods like manual cleaning and waterjet cleaning being slow and highly inefficient processes respectively, there was a need for an automated mechanism which was fast, reliable and did not waste resources. The transition was intended to ensure a safer process with lesser manpower required in addition to being easier to implement.  Over the course of developing this robotic cleaning mechanism, two complete prototypes were designed and implemented in the drains. The performance of both the models has been discussed in detail.  \n\nTick Collection Robot for Rough Outdoor Terrain\n\nBy Chen Chen, Jorge Benito Montejo, Niki Harrison, Qiu Yesiliang\n\nThe objective of this project is to develop a rugged and lightweight robotic platform that acts autonomously, following a course outlined in a convenient graphical interface via wireless user device, to collect ticks in a variety of outdoor terrains, ranging from relatively flat areas of leaf litter to tall grass to heavily forested areas containing numerous obstacles and rough, uneven terrain. The robot will perform active tick sampling (via flagging or dragging procedures) or passive tick trapping. \n\nIt will make use of CO2 or other chemical attractants by way of a centralized dispersal system, allowing it to attract ticks to its traps as well as to its flag/drag cloth. The robot will have four distinct types of environmental sensors to facilitate navigation and decision making: one GPS localization unit, one 360-degree laser point scanner or LIDAR system, a set of passive tactile collision sensors, and a set of active tactile sensors. \n\nDevelopment of Robotic Cell for Removing Tabs from Engine Blade\n\nBy Prateek Sahay,\n\nThe purpose of this project is to design and prototype an automated robotic part process system for completing a few final process steps of machining engine blades. The targeted final steps include reading and checking part identification, marking new information, cutting the tabs, and polishing the cutting areas. \n\nThe focus of this project is on cutting off two tabs from the engine blade and make sure that the cutting surfaces are blended well with part edge. The ultimate goals of this automation research are to eliminate human errors and reduce cycle time in the process. \n\nEMG Controlled Soft Robotic Bicep Augmentation\n\nBy Jiayue Zhang, Daniel Vanderbilt, Ethan Fitz\n\nIndustry workers’ jobs often require them to lift heavy objects. Repeated heavy loading of their arms throughout the workday can lead to muscle or tendon injuries. Hence, the objective of this study is to develop a wearable soft robotic arm enhancement device that will share lifting loads with the user’s muscles to increasing their lifting capacity and reducing fatigue. This project involves developing a soft actuator, a control system, and a method of attaching the actuator to the user’s arms. The McKibben inspired pneumatic muscle acts as the soft actuator of the prototype. EMG control is used for the controlling system. Setups and results of testing for the pneumatic muscle, the controlling algorithm, and the overall performance are discussed. Based on the experiment data, the wearable device prototype can help workers work for a longer time duration, but the improvement of strength varies from person to person.\n\nUsing Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation to Identify Lost Seniors\n\nBy Pradyumna Elavarthi\n\nThe purpose of this project is to design and develop an image segmentation method to identify the seniors lost in a senior community village. The live videos or images are fed from the drones hovering over the village once a lost senior is reported. \n\nA Fully Convolutional Neural Network will be built and trained with the data from Unity Simulator to perform semantic segmentation. \n\nAutomated Resistor Element Assembly Cell\n\nBy Mark A. Bohman \n\nThe resistor element pin spacer assembly (“pinning”) that is currently performed at Post Glover Resistors, Inc. is a physically taxing and time-consuming process and it puts various unwanted physical stress on the assembler. \n\nTwo of the parts are sharp-edged stainless-steel plates that expose the worker to cut hazards, and these plates are held apart by a ceramic pin spacer that is held in place by push nuts on the outer faces of the plates. Due to the time-consuming nature of the current process, and with an emphasis on worker safety, Post Glover Resistors, Inc. needs an automated solution for the resister element assembly work.\n\nTwo of the parts are sharp-edged stainless-steel plates that expose the worker to cut hazards, and these plates are held apart by a ceramic pin spacer that is held in place by push nuts on the outer faces of the plates. Due to the time-consuming nature of the current process, and with an emphasis on worker safety, Post Glover Resistors, Inc. needs an automated solution for the resister element assembly work. \n\nThe automated resistor element assembly cell was developed using a SCARA robot from ABB, three feeder systems with three tracks to deliver pin spacers and push nuts, a pneumatic system to actuate the end effector fixture, and a three gripping mechanism fixture to pick and place the elements, pins, and spacers. The robot programming was done via ABB’s RobotStudio and the FlexPendant. \n\nDesign an End Effector for Drive-Through Gas Station\n\nBy Khada Gautam\n\nDesign a Bionic Keyboard for Erb-Duchenne Palsy Individuals\n\nBy Joshua Grubbs, Mark Minutolo, Dillion Hilgeford (Computer Engineering)\n\nPlant Propagation Robotic System\n\nBy Noah Kohls, Nick Galbraith, Bryan Wilson\n\nThe goal of this project was to develop and integrate a new robotic system to automatically propagate various sub-species of boxwoods. The current process for propagation is completed manually and requires a worker to take several thousand cuttings, organize them, and individually stick them into soil. This is both time consuming and arduous. A SCARA robot was built with its quickness for pick and place applications. The robot was designed so that it could be 3D printed, which allowed for quick prototypes and design iterations. The robot is programmed through an open loop control system and requires occasional resetting to verify the correct location. In order to fully automate this process, a feeder system is built to supply a constant feed of plants to the robot, requiring no manual effort and little wait time. The feeder system works through a process of looping with a refeed on failure. This means that the cuttings will repeatedly go through the system until they arrive to the robot in the correct orientation. "

The primary focus of the project will be on alloy 600, whereas a few studies on alloy 690 will be conducted for comparison with previous work on non-surface treated materials and future potential application. The research program designed accordingly includes the following key elements/tasks:\n\n\nProcurement of alloys 600 and 690, heat treatment studies, purchase and installation of devices for fatigue crack growth measurements\nLSP processing of base metal and welds/HAZ of alloys 600 and 690\nmeasurement and mapping of surface and sub-surface residual strains/stresses and microstructural changes as a function of process parameters using novel methods\ndetermination of thermal relaxation of residual stresses (macro and micro) and microstructure evolution with time at high temperatures typical of service conditions and modeling of the kinetics of relaxation\nevaluation of the effects of residual stress, near surface microstructure and temperature on fatigue properties, fatigue crack nucleation and growth and mechanisms, and SCC initiation and growth behavior and associated microstructural mechanisms\ndevelopment of a robust modeling and simulation approach for determining the effects of LSP on residual stress, microstructure, thermal stability, fatigue life and SCC initiation mechanisms.\nPast Research\nA Study of the Effects of Laser Shock Peening on Residual Stress, Microstructure and Local Properties of IN718 Ni-Base Superalloy\nFunding Agencies: GE Aviation, NSF (Grant No. DMR-0706161) , Battelle-DOE-NEUP (contract # 88635)GE Aviation\n\nIn this project the effects of Laser shock peening (LSP) on the aero engine Ni-Base alloys, IN718 and IN718 SPF were studied. The primary goal of the research was to secure the required fundamental knowledge of the impact of LSP process parameters on the microstructure, residual stress and local properties of alloys and thereby advance the science and application base of this process to other materials and parts. The research program designed accordingly includes the following key elements:\n\nDeveloping LSP process parameters for typical Ni base aero engine alloys;\nCharacterization of surface and sub-surface macro and micro residual strains/stresses a function of LSP process parameters\nCharacterization of microstructural changes as a function of LSP process parameters and\nStudy of the thermal relaxation of residual stresses and understand the underlying kinetics.\nA Study Of The Effects of Laser Shock Peening (LSP) On the Fatigue Life Of Ti-6Al-4V (ELI) Spinal Implant Rods\nFunding Agencies: Ohio Third Frontier Wright Projects Program\n\nSolid implant rods made of Ti-6Al-4V (ELI) are currently used in spinal implant devices. Due to the high stiffness of these solid rods, the implant devices are unable the meet the needs for increased flexibility over a wide range of human activities owing to changes in lifestyles and in human work environments, thereby, necessitating the need for more flexible rods. Hence, designing, developing, manufacturing and testing flexible spinal implant rods was the aim of this project. In this project, increased flexibility was achieved by reducing the cross-section of the solid rods. Since reduction in cross-section leads to reduced load bearing capacity, the fatigue endurance level of the flexible rods is lowered. In order to increase the endurance levels of these flexible rods, Laser Shock Peening (LSP) has been used. As a part of this project, the Ohio Center for Laser Shock Processing of Advanced Materials and Devices (LSP Center)was set-up at the University of Cincinnati through the Ohio State Third Frontier Wrights Projects funding. This project is a collaborative effort between the LSP Center and X-Spine Systems Inc., an implant devices manufacturer based in Miamisburg, Ohio.\n"

The HVAC system serves three 8 by 8 ft well-insulated and controlled environmental zones. The HVAC systems are (1) chilled water VAV system, (2) DX VAV system, (3) four-pipe fan coil units, and (4) Variable Refrigerant Flow VRF. The chilled water VAV system and DX multi-zone VAV systems shares the same air distribution system with three single-duct hot-water reheat VAV boxes, providing cold and warm air to meet the cooling or heating loads in the zones. The VAV system can operate as single or dual duct systems. The heating or cooling loads can be artificially introduced in each zone by any of the system listed above. The chilled water central plant and hot water central plant produce chilled and hot water to terminal units (fan coil units) and the central AHU.\n\nThe lab settings is based on most recent developments in building energy system and have the flexibility to address a wide range of research studies. The operation and control of all equipment is achieved through a “real” web-based BACnet building automation system that is integrated with may innovative computational data-enabled energy solution tools.\n\nChilled Water VAV System\n\nThe chilled water VAV system consists AHU with heating and cooling coils, outside air intake, dampers, and etc. The system serves three zones with VAV boxes with hot water reheat. \n\nAir Side Economizer\n\nThe system contains three dampers: outside, return, and exhaust dampers to control the amount of ventilation introduced to the system. If the outside air is suitable, the control activates the economizer so an appropriate amount of fresh will be introduced to produce free cooling. The control provides several control strategies to active the economizer. A new strategy can be added to the control. \n\nVAV System Control Strategy\n\nThe system has the following major control loops: space control loops, supply air temperature SAT control loop, and duct static pressure control loop, and ventilation control loop. The SAT control is to maintain the SAT at its setpoint by modulating the cooling coil valve, heating coil valve, or outside/retune/discharge dampers. The duct static pressure control is to maintain the duct static pressure at its set point by modulating the fan speed. The zone air temperature is controlled by two cascaded control loops; the error between the space temperature and its setpoint determines the airflow rate setpoint in the first control loop, and the VAV box damper is modulated to maintain the airflow rate at its setpoint in the second loop.\n\nThe control set points can be reset through multiple build-in control strategy options but any future strategies can be added for testing.  \n\nReturn Duct and Fan\n\nThe system is equipped with return air duct and fan to bring the air back form the zones to central chilled water AHU. The fan is controlled to maintain a slightly positive pressure in the zone.  \n\nDX VAV System\n\nThe DX VAV system consists DX coil through an air-sourced heat pump to provide heating or cooling as needed. The system serves three zones with VAV boxes with hot water reheat.\n\nAir Side Economizer\n\nThe system contains three dampers: outside , return , and exhaust dampers to control the amount of ventilation introduced to the system. if the outside air is suitable, the control activates the economizer so an appropriate amount of fresh will be introduced to produce free cooling. The control provides several control strategies to active the economizer. A new strategy can be added to the control. \n\nVAV System Control Strategy\n\nThe system has the following major control loops: space control loops, supply air temperature SAT control loop, and duct static pressure control loop, and ventilation control loop. The SAT control is to maintain the SAT at its setpoint by modulating the cooling or heating DX coil capacity or outside/retune/discharge dampers. The duct static pressure control is to maintain the duct static pressure at its set point by modulating the fan speed. The zone air temperature is controlled by two cascaded control loops; the error between the space temperature and its setpoint determines the airflow rate setpoint in the first control loop, and the VAV box damper is modulated to maintain the airflow rate at its setpoint in the second loop.\n\nThe control set points can be reset through multiple build-in control strategy options but any future strategies can be added for testing. \n\nReturn Duct and Fan\n\nThe system is equipped with return air duct and fan to bring the air back form the zones to central chilled water AHU. The fan is controlled to maintain a slightly positive pressure in the zone.  \n\nDual Duct VAV systems\n\nThe chilled water AHU and DX AHU can operate simultaneously; one supplies cold air and other supplies warm air to the three zones (testing chambers) through dual duct VAV boxes.   \n\nVAV boxes\n\nEach zone is served by VAV boxes operating as single or dual inlet VAV box. This configuration allows the system work as single or dual-duct VAV systems. \n\nChilled Water Central Plant\n\nThe chilled water system consists of one air cooled chiller with two pumps. There are two water piping configuration options:  (1) primary/secondary or (2) primary only configuration. The chiller serves VAV AHU coil and three fan coils located in zones. All pumps are equipped with VFDs\n\nHot Water Central Plant\n\nThe hot water system consists of one electric boiler with two pumps. There are two water piping configuration options:  (1) primary/secondary or (2) primary only configuration. The boiler serves VAV AHU coil, VAV box reheat coils, and three fan coils located in zones. All pumps are equipped with VFDs\n\nFan Coil Units\n\nThe three zones (lab chambers) serves also by fan coil units FCUs. The FCUs are four pipe configuration with hot and chilled water coils. A variable speed fan is used to circulate air. The chilled and hot water central plants serving the AHU coils also serve the FCUs. Two pipe configuration can be selected to operate through BAS:  (1) primary/secondary or (2) primary only configuration. \n\nVariable Refrigerant Flow Units\n\nThe three zones (lab chambers) serves also by VRF indoor cascades. The VRF system contains condensing unit located outside the lab and heat recovery system . "

Current regenerative systems primarily rely on 1) material implants whose biodegradation rates can drastically diverge from the pace of new tissue formation, and 2) poorly controlled pharmaceutic delivery that incompletely recapitulate natural healing processes. Consequently, there remains a need for regenerative medicine platforms that can selectively release therapeutics and biodegrade in response to localized, cell-specific healing responses.\n\nTherefore, our group explores bioresponsive, \"smart\" material systems that leverage precise, cell-generated signals (including presence of reactive oxygen species, pH changes, and enzymatic activity) to activate biomaterial functionality and guide tissue regeneration.\n\nOrthopedic tissue engineering with cell-degradable scaffolds\nCritically-sized bone defects are conventionally treated with patient-derived bone grafts; as such, \"off-the-shelf\" bone replacement therapies would improve patient quality of life and reduce healthcare costs.\nThough newer composites with inorganic ceramics and biodegradable synthetic polymers have shown promise as osteoinductive scaffolds, many conventional polyester-based systems are prone to autocatalytic degradation and premature implant failure in preclinical testing.\nTo combat the disconnect between bone regeneration rates and scaffold degradation kinetics, our lab will seek to develop a cell-degradable bone substitute.\nA specifically cell-degradable implant will marry implant resorption with healing kinetics, thus preventing premature implant failure and improving bone regeneration outcomes.\nMulti-stage, healing-responsive drug delivery\nMost localized drug delivery platforms focus on the sustained delivery of a single therapeutic agent, while natural regeneration cascades feature a multitude of sequential or overlapping signalling pathways.\nDrug delivery systems featuring layer-by-layer (LbL) coatings demonstrate precise control over the timing and dosing of therapeutic delivery; however, LbL films have been typically been constrained to coatings on pre-formed implants.\nThis work will seek to develop injectable, cell-degradable microparticles coated with cell-degradable LbL constructs, thereby combining the tunability of LbL drug delivery with the minimally-invasive delivery of microparticles.\nThese microparticle / LbL systems will be able to facilitate locally-responsive, multi-stage delivery of therapeutics via an injectable format.\nOn-demand antibiotic delivery from dental implants\nDental implants are highly susceptible to bacterial colonization and are conventionally treated by systemic antibiotics (with ensuing off-target effects).\nOur initial goal is to explore the local tissue environment surrounding infected dental implants to identify infection-specific hallmarks such as bacterial toxins, pH changes, oxidative stress, etc.\nAfter identifying suitable targets, efforts will focus on creating layer-by-layer drug coatings on the surfaces of implants that selectively release antibiotics in response to infection-specific stimuli.\nResponsive antibiotic-releasing drug coatings will drastically extend payload delivery timelines and could serve as a prophylactic for infection prevention."

The program began in 1967 in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering by the late Professors John Pattison and Charles Gruber. Over the years the program has graduated more than 400 Master's students and 55 Ph.D. students, and has developed an international reputation for quality research and training. The current faculty in the program is Dr. Mingming Lu.\n\n\nThe program offers majors in either Environmental Engineering or Environmental Science. The former is for graduates with accredited undergraduate engineering majors who will focus on the engineering aspects of air pollution control. The latter is for graduates with science majors who will be emphasizing the physical and life science aspects of air pollution. A detailed explanation of the requirements for a non-engineer to enter the Environmental Engineering major is available on the website. Because the Program is interdepartmental, students have available air pollution courses from any of the three departments.\n\n\nFurther, the research laboratories of each department are open to student for thesis/dissertation research projects with approval of the faculty member responsible for the laboratory. This is especially important since the research work done in each laboratory has a different emphasis. The courses available in each department that are of most interest to air pollution students are listed on the website. The faculty research focus is on sustainable energy solutions that address concerns related to air quality, climate change, and energy production. Please consult with the program faculty for a description of current research activities.\n\nFaculty\nMingming Lu\n\nProfessor, CEAS - Environmental Eng & Science\n\n770 MANTEI\n\n513-556-0996\n\nlumg@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nVIEW FULL PROFILE"

In the email, include the following information:\nApproximately how large are the expected parts for each student? \nHow many students in total will be printing? \nWhat is the timeline for when the parts are expected to be printed? \nAre there any special considerations for material properties, color, or structure for these parts? \nThe class code will be used by students to access a special group of printers dedicated to your class!\n\nNote: Although the lab gives special access to printer groups for class use, it is the responsibility of the students to submit their parts in a timely manner to have them for class. If students all wait to print before a deadline or if they don’t account for possible print failures the delay in receiving their part is their own responsibility. It is with this in mind that I encourage you to have your students print earlier rather then later. Contact ceas3dprintfarm@ucmail.uc.edu with any questions or concerns"

A mean-field model of the gamma prime precipitation is used to predict the nucleation and growth for two nickel superalloys under fast and slow continuous cooling of small-scale lab specimen. The predicted volumes of the precipitates are compared to 3D reconstructions obtained using Focused Ion Beam serial sectioning. The multiple nucleation burst events known to this alloy type are characterized by in-situ cooling experiments and compared to predictions. Spatial effects of the gamma prime evolution are obtained by applying the model to the element integration points of a FEM-based heat transfer model to approximate rate-dependent latent heat effects. The heat released during the evolution is shown to have a cascading effect on the overall heat transfer observed, the implications of which are demonstrated using embedded thermo-couple experiments.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nNick Krutz is a Materials Engineer within the Materials Department at GE Aviation specializing in physics-based modeling and physical metallurgy of nickel superalloys. Nick began his career at GE after completing his undergraduate coursework at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Upstate New York in 2012. While at GE, he completed his M.S. in Materials Science from The Ohio State University.

Most advances in technology have followed advances in materials.\n\nNew metallic alloys, lead to more efficient improved jet engines and lighter weight alloys for automobiles. \n\nImproved polymers underlie the ten-fold increase in tire life since the first balloon tires. \nNew ceramic materials are the basis of the fiber-optics communication industry. Flat screen TVs are possible because of advances in electronic, polymeric and ceramic materials.\n\nThe Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) program at the University of Cincinnati is at the frontier of the materials research including fundamental polymer characterization methods, synthesis of polymer composites, surface science and adhesive thin films, nano transducers and sensors, surface-engineered alloys, nanostructured materials, energy devices, and nanotechnology applications in biomedicine. The faculty consists of experienced educators prominent in diversified materials-science fields including seconadary appointments held by professors from other engineering programs and from Colleges of Arts & Science and Medicine. Additionally, UC offers undergraduate minors in Materials Engineering and Nano Engineering, with several major lab courses that focus on hands-on materials engineering skills.\n\nUC offers graduate degrees of MS and Ph.D with focuses on polymers, metallurgy, and ceramics. Core and elective courses range from fundamentals to newly developed courses on emerging materials. These are rigorous classes covering all materials science disciplines such as Diffraction Theory, Advanced Thermodynamics, Phase Transformation, Fundamentals of Polymer Science, Physical Properties of Solids, and Soft matter.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nMaterials have been traditionally classified as metals, ceramics and polymers based on the atomic-level bonding. Emerging materials, however, often employ more complex structures, such as metal matrix composites and ceramics toughened with polymers. Properties of these new materials depend not only on atomic-level bonding, but on larger-scale structures in the range 10 – 100 nm, which has led to a new discipline called nano-materials engineering.\n\nSoft materials are another emerging class of materials that includes gels, colloids, liquids, foams, and coatings. The soft materials approach uses the tools of organic chemistry to synthesize new artificial materials that often mimic the properties of bone, skin and other biological structures. Soft materials typically display properties that are distinctively different from those of classic bulk materials. So called smart materials, for example, are environmentally responsive such as self-darkening sunglasses and self-cleaning windows.\n\nElectronic materials are classified broadly by their conductivity: conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Other important electronic properties include superconductivity, ferroelectricity and photoelectricity. The modern microelectronics revolution is built on manipulation of the electronic and magnetic properties of materials. Equally important are optically responsive polymers used to create the masks used in the semiconductor processing industry."

One of the overarching practical challenges in this area is in figuring out how to operate extensive computing architectures at very low (cryogenic) temperatures, as typically needed to stabilize physical quantum systems. A big part of the solution is in reimagining electrical circuits by integrating materials that are superconducting (i.e. their electrical resistance becomes zero below a certain temperature).\n\nThis project will be part of a larger effort to develop new fabrication procedures for superconducting quantum devices that operate at cryogenic temperatures. Scientifically, this project will focus on enabling the use of oxide perovskite materials (SrTiO3 and KTaO3) in cryogenic quantum technologies. The goal is to leverage their unique material properties into new device functionalities, in particular the tunability of superconductivity and dielectric constant by electrics fields.\n\nThe student will learn the basics of electrical device testing, Python-based measurement control and automation, cryogenic measurements, and device simulation. The student will have the opportunity to get involved with fabrication of devices in the Mantei Center Cleanroom at UC. \n\nFigure: Quantum nanoconstriction device defined in a superconducting oxide SrTiO3, using a combination of ionic liquid gating and local tuning with nanopatterned split gates.\n\nDirectors\nMarc M Cahay\n\nProfessor, Department Head, CEAS - Electrical and Computer Engineeri\n\n812J Rhodes Hall\n\n513-556-4754\n\ncahaymm@ucmail.uc.edu\n\nM.

Sometimes, we cannot offer academically strong students admission to their top choice CEAS majors; when this happens, we offer them spots in FEP to ensure that they have the support and resources necessary to graduate from CEAS.\n\nBenefits of the First-Year Engineering Program (FEP)\nGuaranteed Admission\n\nFEP students are guaranteed admission to all CEAS programs if they meet the FEP Criteria. \n\nAdvising and Mentorship\n\nThe First-Year Engineering Program Academic Advisors advise fewer than 200 students each year compared to a 400:1 college-wide ratio. This means that the FEP Academic Advisors can provide a high-level of individualized support, proactive advising, and success skill development during students’ first years. In addition, every FEP student is assigned to a faculty Career Mentor who serves as an additional guide during their first year at UC. \n\nCollege Inclusion\n\nThe First-Year Engineering Program is housed in the Department of Engineering and Computing Education in CEAS; this means that FEP students are already in the College of Engineering and Applied Science. FEP students are included in all college communications, events, and activities. \n\nChoosing a CEAS Major\n\nAll students, whether you're set on your engineering or engineering technology discipline of choice or still exploring, will be well-supported on their journeys to find their best-fit majors at UC. Events like Engineer Your Major and resources such as My Majors are integrated into the FEP student experience to help students get the most out of their time in the program.\n\nTransitioning to a Major from FEP\n\nFEP students have up to three academic semesters to meet the FEP Criteria for their applied program(s). \n\nContact Us\n\nCheck out the First-Year Engineering Program YouTube playlist for more detailed information about the program. \n\nPlease direct any questions about the First-Year Engineering Program to CEASAdvis@uc.edu."

Unlike the Overall UC GPA, transfer and test (AP, IB, etc.) grades are factored into your Math/Science GPA.\n\nMath/Science GPA calculations will consider the “best attempt” at any applicable math/science courses:\n\n“Best attempt” refers to a grade in a course that results in the highest GPA possible. For programs that allow science electives (i.e. students choose PHYS2002/L or CHEM1041/L), calculations will use the best attempt at any combination of required courses where applicable.  \nFor example: If a student earned both a C- and an A in MATH1061, the Math/Science GPA will use the best attempt – an A – in the Math/Science GPA calculation. \nApplicable Courses By Program\nCourses by program\nProgram\n\tMath/Science Courses \n\t \n\n\nAerospace Engineering (ASE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2063, MATH2073, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, PHYS2002, PHYS2002L\n\n\t \n\n\nArchitectural Engineering (AE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2074, MATH2076, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, PHYS2002, PHYS2002L, STAT2037\n\n\t \n\n\nBiomedical Engineering (BME)\n\n\t\n\nBIOL2001C, CHEM1040, CHEM1040L, CHEM1041, CHEM1041L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2074, PHYS2001, PHYS2002\n\n\t \n\n\nChemical Engineering (CHE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, CHEM1041, CHEM1041L, CHEM2040, CHEM2040L, CHEM2041, CHEM2041L, CHEM3030, CHEM3030L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2073, PHYS2001, PHYS2002\n\n\t \n\n\nCivil Engineering (CE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2074, MATH2076, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, (CHEM1041 or PHYS2002), (CHEM1041L or PHYS2002L)\n\n\t \n\n\nComputer Engineering (CMPE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, EECE2065, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2063, MATH2076, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, PHYS2076, STAT2037, CS2071\n\n\t \n\n\nComputer Science (CS)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2076, STAT2037, (BIOL1081 or CHEM1041 or PHYS2001), (BIOL1081L or CHEM1041L or PHYS2001L), CS2071\n\n\t \nCybersecurity Engineering (CYE)\tCHEM1040, CS2071, EECE2065, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2076, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, STAT2037\t \n\n\nElectrical Engineering (EE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, EECE2065, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2063, MATH2076, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, PHYS2076, STAT2037\n\n\t \n\n\nEnvironmental Engineering (ENVE)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, CHEM1041, CHEM1041L, CHEM2040, CHEM2040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2074, PHYS2001\n\n\t \nIndustrial & Systems Engineering (ISE)\tCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2063, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, PHYS2002, PHYS2002L\t \n\n\nMechanical Engineering (ME)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, CHEM1040L, MATH1061, MATH1062, MATH2063, MATH2073, PHYS2001, PHYS2001L, PHYS2002, PHYS2002L\n\n\t \n\n\nMechanical Engineering Tech (MET)\n\n\t\n\nCHEM1040, MATH1061, PHYS1051, PHYS1051L, PHYS1052, PHYS1052L, STAT1031\n\n\t \n\nCEAS will include known course equivalents for the courses outlined above in our Math/Science GPA calculations.\n\nPass (P) Grades and Test Credit\n\nPass (P) grades and AP credit will have a neutral (N/A) impact on students’ Math/Science GPAs when they can be considered as the “best attempts,” meaning that the neutral grade results in a higher Math/Science GPA than an earned grade. \n\nDual Enrollment (College Credit Plus) and Transfer Credit\n\nCEAS will manually calculate earned letter grades for any transfer credit in applicable math/science courses for the Math/Science GPA only.

    "html": "College of Engineering and Applied Science » Academics » Majors & Programs » Minors and Certificates » Wood Technology » Frequently Asked Questions\n\nSet Navigation title in component\nDepartments\nMajors & Programs\nUndergraduate\nGraduate\nMinors and Certificates\nWood Technology\nFrequently Asked Questions\nContact Us\nCourses\nGraduate Advising\nUndergraduate Advising\nWood Technology Frequently Asked Questions\nEnrolling in Classes\nWhere do I find the classes offered next semester?\n\nAll classes offered in the current & the following semester can be found on the UC website, OneStop.\n\n\nClick the “View Class Offerings” red button near the middle of the page.\n\n\nClick the “Search and View Class Offerings” red button.\nNext to \"Term\" click on drop-down menu and select the term you want to take a class.\nNext to \"Subject\" click on drop-down menu and select \"CBMK - Cabinet and Furniture Making\"\nNext to \"Campus\" click on \"Victory Parkway Campus\"\nUn-Check the box next to \"Show Open Classes Only\" to see all courses offered, both full and open courses.\n\nClick the \"Search\" button and you will see all courses offered.\n\nClass detail information can be seen by clicking on the red text under the class or section columns. The green dot means the course has available seats (Open) and the blue box means the course is full (Closed).\n\n\nTo return to the list of WT Program courses, click on the \"VIEW SEARCH RESULTS\" button under the class detail information.\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to contact Mark Costello.\n\nHow do I register for classes once I found the course I am interested in taking?\n\nFirst, if you have never taken a class at UC, you will need to contact the UC Office of the Registrar to complete the \"Basic Data Form\"and the Registrar wiill create a Unique ID for you.\n\nTo register for a course go to the UC Admissions website for \"Becoming a Non-Matriculated Student\" and you will find information to register.\n\nHow many courses can I take?\n\nYou can take just one course or as many courses as you like. \n\n\nI want to register for the Wood Turning I class but OneStop only lists Wood Turning II?\n\nMost courses in the WT Program do not have \"Prerequisites\". This means you can enroll in Wood Turning II before taking Wood Turning I. This also applies to CNC Router Woodworking,  Furniture Drawing, Wood Crafts, Wood Carving as well as the Wood Technology series courses. In all these areas of study beginning students work along side advanced students. The instructor adapts the assignments to suit the student's skill level.\n\nNOTE: All Furniture Construction courses & Windsor Chair courses have \"Prerequisites\" which means you must take the courses in sequence.\n\nGeneral Questions\nI am just getting started in woodworking, can I take classes in your program?\n\nThe WT Program offers courses appropriate for the beginning woodworker. If you are interested in taking a Furniture Construction course, the first course you would take is Furniture Construction IA. You can also take any other course in the WT Program as a beginner.\n\n\nWhat class should I take first?\n\nIf you are interested in taking a Furniture Construction class, the first course you would take is Furniture Construction IA.\n\nThe Furniture Construction classes must be taken in sequence. The academic phrase, \"Prerequisit\" will appear on OneStop indicated by a yellow tri-angle. A Class Prerequisite means you must take certain classes prior to the class you want to enroll in. The only other class with a Prerequisite is the Windsor Chair Construction classes because it takes two semesters to complete one Windsor Chair.\n\n\nThe Furniture Construction courses are not a Class Prerequisite for other areas of study such as: CNC Router Woodworking, Furniture Drawing, Wood Crafts, Wood Turning or Wood Carving, etc.\n\nI have done some carpentry and woodworking, can I take the advanced Furniture Construction classes to start?\n\nCarpentry is very different from woodworking & furniture making. Although carpentry uses some of the same power equipment and hand tools, the Wood Technology Program teaches crafting fine furniture and art objects. Therefore, we require students take Furniture Construction classes in sequence starting with Furniture Construction IA.\n\nIf you believe your woodworking skills are more advanced than a beginning course, feel free to contact Mark Costello. We can schedule a time to meet at the Wood Shop and you can bring photo's of your work. We are more than happy to discuss this with you.\n\nWhen are classes offered?\n\nWood Technology courses meet for approximately (3) hours, one day per week for the full semester. Courses are typically scheduled in the late afternoons, Monday through Thursday.\n\nTo find see academic calendars go to the OneStop website calendar page.\n\n\nNOTE: All WT Program classrooms are available to students only during scheduled class time for the course they are enrolled. WT Program does not have \"open shops\".\n\nWhere are classes located?\n\nAll Wood Technology classes are offered on UC's Victory Parkway Campus (VPC) at 2220 Victory Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45206.\n\nSee our Location and UC Shuttle web page.\n\nHow much does it cost to take one class?\n\nSince the WT Program is part of the University of Cincinnati all tuition and fees apply. Verify tuition costs by contacting UC Admissions.\n\n\nAlthough tuition is expensive, each class meets for 2 hours & 50 minutes every week, each week of the term (13 & 16 weeks including exam week). With this information you can break down the tuition cost per hour. The WT Program strives to provide value for the cost.\n\nAdditional Fees for WT Program courses:\n\nEach class has a \"shop fee\" required for supplies such as sanding, blade sharpening etc. These fees range from $10 to $30 per semester each class.\n\nStudents must purchase the materials to complete the project(s) assigned.\nProvide their own personal safety equipment (dust mask, ear protection and safety glasses).\n\nSome classes in the WT Program require a text book but most books assigned can be purchased used from an online book seller.\nContact Mark Costello for the current fees for the course you are interested in taking.\nCurrent UC Student Questions\nWhat if I am enrolled in a UC College other than the College of Engineering and Applied Science?\n\nStudents from any college, campus and major can take classes in the Wood Technology Program.\n\n\nI am a full time UC student, are there additional costs associated with taking your classes?\n\nIf you are currently a full time UC student you might be able to take a course at no additional tuition cost. Verify tuition costs by contacting UC Admissions.\n\n\nEach class has a \"shop fee\" that covers supplies such as sanding, blade sharpening etc. These fees range from $10 to $30 per semester for each class. Contact Mark Costello for the current fee for the course you are interested in taking.\n\nAlso, students must purchase the materials to complete the project(s) assigned and personal safety equipment (dust mask, ear protection and safety glasses). Last, classes in the WT Program require a text book but most books assigned can be purchased used from an online book seller.\n\nCan I earn college credit toward my degree by taking one of your classes?\n\nYes, all WT Program classes are college level and the grade you earn in our classes count toward your GPA.\n\nIn addition to being college level classes, all classes in the WT Program meet Breadth of Knowledge Requirements (BoK) in the distribution area of Fine Arts (FA).  UC's GenEd program assures exposure to the traditional disciplines that are the hallmark of a liberally educated person.\n\nNon-UC Student Questions\nI am currently a UC employee, can I take your classes?\n\nYes, all WT Program classes are open to UC employees. If your current position with UC provides tuition remission benefits, you may be able to apply tuition remission to the WT Program classes. Verify if tuition remission applies by contacting UC Benefits. All WT Program shop fees & material costs are required even when tuition remission applies.\n\n\nI am a retired UC employee, can I take your classes?\n\nYes, all WT Program classes are open to retired UC employees.

The MS ACCEND track culminates in a research experience and thesis.\n\nMaster of Science (MS) Cosmetic Science\n\nThe ACCEND program that offers an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering along with the Master of Science in Costmetic Science at the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy. \n\nCostmetic Science Requirements\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Business Administration at the Lindner College of Business will appeal to students who want to understand both the technical side of an organization and the business aspects of the organization. Students seek this program because it increases their value to an organization and prepares them to take on a management role earlier in their careers. Tuition and fees for the MBA program through ACCEND are managed by the Lindner College of Business. Students should discuss costs with an LCB advisor.\n\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Engineering will appeal to students interested in greater breadth in engineering and want to focus on the practice of engineering.\n\nThese students often are seeking pragmatic skills and knowledge that will allow them to improve the contribution they make to a technical organization. The MEng provides a traditional coursework based master’s and does not include a thesis component.\n\nMaster of Education in Curriculum & Instruction (MEd)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Curriculum and Instruction will appeal to students who have an interest in teaching in high school, middle school, or possibly community college.\n\nThe program provides the rigorous technical education of the engineering degree along with the teaching skills and certifications needed to work in education.\n\nJuris Doctorate (J.D.)\n\nThe ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with a Juris Doctorate (J.D.) in Law will appeal to students who want to enter the legal profession.  Engineer-attorneys can sit for the patent bar, and are also well-equipped to handle many other transactional or litigation matters that center upon technical issues.  (Students will not be able to complete JD at the same time as their bachelor’s degree.  However, they can complete 15-30 credits of the 90 credit hour degree prior to BS graduation.)\n\nAdding the MS, MEng, or MBA program\nApplying to the MS, MEng, or MBA program\n\nACCEND Students must have an open graduate program so graduate courses count toward that degree.  That requires ACCEND students apply to the Graduate School prior to taking any graduate level courses. Students should apply to the graduate program the semester before they are ready to take their first graduate course.  Instructions for applying to the Graduate program are provided below.  Both the undergraduate and the graduate programs will be open – students will register for graduate classes in the graduate career, and undergraduate classes in the undergraduate career.\n\nImportant Billing Information\nWhen a student registers for 6 or fewer graduate level semester hours, tuition and fees will be at the undergraduate level.\nWhen a student registers for 7 or more graduate level semester hours, tuition and fees will be at the graduate level.\n\nCourse planning is of critical importance. Students should take no more than 6 grad credits any semester prior to the 5th year\n\nExpand AllCollapse All\nSteps to Apply to the Graduate School \nFinancial Aid \nScholarships \nGraduation\nYou will need to apply to graduate from both programs and you will pay the graduation fee twice\nYou cannot graduate from your Graduate Program before you graduate with your undergraduate degree, but you can graduate from both programs in the same term, or your BS program one term, and your MS, MENG, or MBA a later term"

Sometimes, we cannot offer academically strong students admission to their top choice CEAS majors; when this happens, we offer them spots in FEP to ensure that they have the support and resources necessary to graduate from CEAS.\n\nBenefits of the First-Year Engineering Program (FEP)\nGuaranteed Admission\n\nFEP students are guaranteed admission to all CEAS programs if they meet the FEP Criteria. \n\nAdvising and Mentorship\n\nThe First-Year Engineering Program Academic Advisors advise fewer than 200 students each year compared to a 400:1 college-wide ratio. This means that the FEP Academic Advisors can provide a high-level of individualized support, proactive advising, and success skill development during students’ first years. In addition, every FEP student is assigned to a faculty Career Mentor who serves as an additional guide during their first year at UC. \n\nCollege Inclusion\n\nThe First-Year Engineering Program is housed in the Department of Engineering and Computing Education in CEAS; this means that FEP students are already in the College of Engineering and Applied Science. FEP students are included in all college communications, events, and activities. \n\nChoosing a CEAS Major\n\nAll students, whether you're set on your engineering or engineering technology discipline of choice or still exploring, will be well-supported on their journeys to find their best-fit majors at UC. Events like Engineer Your Major and resources such as My Majors are integrated into the FEP student experience to help students get the most out of their time in the program.\n\nTransitioning to a Major from FEP\n\nFEP students have up to three academic semesters to meet the FEP Criteria for their applied program(s). \n\nContact Us\n\nCheck out the First-Year Engineering Program YouTube playlist for more detailed information about the program. \n\nPlease direct any questions about the First-Year Engineering Program to CEASAdvis@uc.edu."

Rather than culminate in a research experience and a thesis, the Master of Engineering curriculum provides skills and expertise that enhance the individual’s ability to contribute to the technical workforce. The difference between the traditional Master of Science degree and the MEng degree is not on the rigor of the coursework or a lack of competencies, but rather on the focus of the curriculum.\n\nThe program provides advanced training to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise.

Rather than culminate in a research experience and a thesis, the Master of Engineering curriculum provides skills and expertise that enhance the individual’s ability to contribute to the technical workforce. The difference between the traditional Master of Science degree and the MEng degree is not on the rigor of the coursework or a lack of competencies, but rather on the focus of the curriculum.\n\nThe program provides advanced training to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise. Depending on a student’s interest, the degree could add significant depth to an individual’s understanding of the practice of engineering or the program could be constructed to focus on greater inter-disciplinary breadth if that is the educational objective of the student. In today’s competitive technology environment, industries need to have highly skilled practicing engineers who are flexible in their professional capabilities. The MEng program is a practice oriented, focused degree and caters to this need.  While students have up to two years to complete the degree, all requirements can be completed in one year.\n\nAdmission Requirements\nGRE - Required of all international students; GRE is exempt for students that earned a degree from an ABET accredited university (or equivalent accreditation) in the USA with a GPA of 3.0+\nTranscript(s) and Degree Certificates (unofficial transcripts are used for admissions review, only admitted applicants submit official transcripts)\nGPA minimum 3.0 or equivalent\nStatement of Purpose\nTwo letters of recommendation\nInternational students - English Proficiency Test: TOEFL (minimum 92) or IELTS (minimum 6.5)\nCurriculum \nApplication Deadlines\n\nApplication deadlines and additional application information can be found at the CEAS Office of Graduate Studies.\n\nAccreditation \nContact Information\nGraduate Studies Office\nPO Box 210077\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0077\n(513) 556-3647\nengrgrad@uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nComputers & Technology\nEngineering\nNatural Science & Math\n\nProgram Code: 20MAS-CHE-MENG"

    "html": "College of Engineering and Applied Science » Academics » Departments » Mechanical and Materials Engineering » Mechanical Engineering » Current Graduate Students\n\nSet Navigation title in component\nDepartments\nAerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics\nBiomedical Engineering\nChemical and Environmental Engineering\nCivil and Architectural Engineering and Construction Management\nComputer Science\nElectrical & Computer Engineering\nEngineering & Computing Education\nMechanical and Materials Engineering\nMajors & Programs\nResearch\nFaculty & Staff\nOpen Positions\nIndustrial & Systems Engineering\nMaterials Science and Engineering\nMechanical Engineering\nFaculty\nCurrent Undergraduate Students\nCurrent Graduate Students\nFuture Graduate Students\nMechanical Engineering Technology\nExternal Advisory Board\nSpeakers\nMajors & Programs\nGraduate Advising\nUndergraduate Advising\nCurrent Mechanical Engineering Graduate Students\n\nThe Mechanical Engineering graduate program is designed to increase the student's breadth of knowledge, to permit depth of specialization, and to provide the opportunity for cutting-edge research. Graduate work in Mechanical Engineering at UC is designed to allow flexibility for students to conduct unique research while learning fundamental basic engineering knowledge. The degrees offered by the ME program are Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, and Masters of Engineering.\n\nResources\nStudent Handbook for M.S. and Ph.D Students\nMaster’s Degree (MS Degree)\n\nThe Mechanical Engineering Graduate Program offers both a thesis and non-thesis program of study for the MS Degree.\n\nEach student is required to develop an individual Program of Study with his/her Academic Advisor. Advisor assignment is usually based on the student's plan of study and the advisor's area of specialization. A copy of the student's Program of Study, signed by the Academic Advisor, must be placed on file in the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) Graduate Studies Office (665 Baldwin Hall) by the student during the first semester registered at the University. A revised copy must also be submitted at the designated times.\n\nFor credit-hour and specific requirements in MS program, please refer to Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Handbook.  \n\nCOURSE LISTINGS\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD Degree)\nCredit Hour Requirement\nA minimum of 90 graduate semester credit hours beyond the bachelor’s degree is required. Completion of a Master’s degree, either prior to matriculation or while enrolled in the Mechanical Engineering graduate program, is a prerequisite to PhD degree completion. A Master’s degree earned prior to matriculation into the program is subject to approval by the Mechanical Engineering graduate studies committee, usually at the time of admission. All students who matriculate into the program with a Master’s degree (whether thesis or non-thesis) will receive 30 credits toward the required 90 for a PhD. Therefore, a minimum of 60 graduate semester credits beyond the Master’s degree is required. Students possessing only a BS degree who are admitted into the direct-admit PhD program are required to complete a Master of Science (MS) degree while enrolled in the program. \nThe required 60 credit hours beyond the MS degree may include up to 42 credit hours for research courses (which must include a minimum of 21 semester hours of MECH-9030 Dissertation with the remainder being comprised of MECH-9015 Research/Thesis). Prior to electing MECH-9030 Dissertation, the student must pass the ME PhD Fundamentals Exam\nIn addition, a minimum of 18 graduate semester credit hours must be classroom work, i.e., academic work other than Research/Thesis (MECH- 9015), Research (MECH-9020), PhD Dissertation (MECH-9030), Topics in Mechanical Engineering (MECH-9021), or Seminar (MECH-9022)\nOf the 18 credit hour classroom course requirement, a minimum of three (3) graduate credit hours of study in advanced mathematics beyond the MS degree are required. In addition to courses offered by the Department of Mathematical Sciences, certain courses in MECH, AEEM, EECE, and other selected programs may be eligible to be approved as substitute courses for the math requirement. Approval by the student’s academic advisor is required. Due to changing course availability, students seeking to use a substitute course for this requirement should contact the Graduate Director for more information\nOf the 18 credit hour classroom course requirement, a minimum of 12 graduate semester credits of Mechanical Engineering courses (MECH-xxxx or EGFD-xxxx) beyond the Master's Degree are required. Research/Thesis (MECH-9015), Topics (MECH-9021), Dissertation (MECH-9030) and Seminar (MECH-9022) do not count toward the requirement. Substitute courses, as previously described, may be allowed on an exception basis to satisfy the MECH course requirement. A petition for a substitute course should be submitted to the ME Graduate Program Director, following a recommendation by the Academic Advisor.\n\nExclusive of seminar and dissertation grades, the grade point average (GPA) in his/her Program of Study must not be less than 3.0 (B average). In addition, a student's GPA for all credits in his/her Program of Study must not be less than 3.0. If a student's term and/or cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, the student is on academic probation until the cumulative GPA is above 3.0; if this deficiency persists for two or more semesters, the student is subject to dismissal. \n\nFull-time traditional students are required to register for the ME Graduate Seminar (MECH-9022). Registration is required during all semesters in which the student maintains full-time status. Non-traditional students (parttime and GE students) are encouraged, but not required to participate. Seminar credits do not count toward credit toward the degree.\nStudents enrolled in the ME graduate program on a continuous, full-time basis beyond a specified period of time (nominally two years in the MS program or three years overall, including both MS and/or PhD study) may apply for a waiver of the seminar requirement. Students in this category may contact the seminar director for more information. \nTransfer of Credits\n\nAs a means of assuring that the character and standards embodied in graduate degrees awarded by the University of Cincinnati are preserved, limits are set on the amount of work completed at other institutions which can be included as fulfilling graduate degree requirements. The limits complement residency requirements, and are:\n\nA maximum of 9 graduate semester credit hours (exclusive of 30 credits for an MS Degree at another university) can be transferred (one time) from another university and/or academic program, upon approval of the Academic Advisor, with subsequent approval from appropriate department and university authorities. Specific policies regarding such transfer of credits are:\nApproval of these courses must be obtained before taking them unless the student is transferring to this program from another university.\nTransfer of graduate credits is not allowed for coursework taken to satisfy the requirements of a previous or concurrent undergraduate or graduate degree program\nCredit hours allowed for a course will not exceed the semester credit\nhours of any University of Cincinnati course(s) which covers equivalent\nmaterial.\nThe student's Academic Advisor must send a written request for transfer\nof credits to the Director of Graduate Studies (ME). Upon approval, the\nDirector of Graduate Studies (ME) will submit the request to the\nUniversity Graduate Faculty for approval.\nThesis or Dissertation work cannot be transferred\nCredits taken at the University of Cincinnati, prior to formal admission to\nthe ME Graduate Program, are likewise limited to 9 graduate credit hours.\nPhD Qualifying Exam\nThe ME PhD Fundamentals Exams must be completed by all students enrolled in Mechanical Engineering PhD program. Students must appear for their first attempt no later than the second time the exams are offered, following their initial date of enrollment in the ME PhD program.\nThe Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. Fundamentals Exam takes place over four days. The student is tested for ninety (90) minutes in each area. A total of nine areas are offered. Any student newly matriculated into the PhD program may appear (during the quarter in which the first attempt occurs) for a maximum of two attempts in five (5) subjects approved by his/her advisor. If a second attempt is required, the student need not re-take subjects which were passed on the first attempt.\nOne of the three selected areas must be a declared primary area of the student’s Program of Study. Students who do not successfully complete this requirement within the required time frame are dismissed from the program. Please note that exceptions are not made for part-time or irregular registration. The student bears the primary responsibility for maintaining his/her enrollment status as well as for maintaining contact with his/her advisor and the COE Graduate Studies Office in order to receive necessary instructions.\nThe student is graded on a pass/fail basis in each area. All exams will be closed book and closed notes - appropriate reference materials will be provided, if necessary. In order to pass the Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. Fundamentals Exam, the student must pass three (3) exams in a maximum of two (2) attempts. No conditional passes will be issued.\nThe following are the nine areas included in the Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. Fundamentals Exam. The offered subjects are:\nFundamental Dynamics and Mechanical Vibrations\nStrength of Materials, including static and dynamic failure theories\nFluid Mechanics\nHeat Transfer\nThermodynamics\nEngineering Statistics\nManufacturing Processes and Systems\nMeasurement and Control\nNuclear and Radiological Engineering\nRepresentative sample exams in the format offered prior to and beginning in the 2007-2008 academic year are available for review within the ME PhD Fundamentals Exam Blackboard organization.  "

This rapidly growing area will enable a variety of novel engineering tools for efficient new energy storage and conversion, mechanical systems, aerospace structures, nano-photonics, semiconducting devices, electronics, biotechnology, medical diagnosis and therapy, and drug delivery. For instance, nanotechnology research has produced such materials as nano imaging agents for early cancer diagnosis, nano carriers for targeted drug delivery, nano composites for supercapacitors and advanced electrochemical energy storage devices; novel pulsed power capacitors for reducing the rate and rapid cycling demand on the batteries of hybrid/electric vehicles, and flexible, highly conductive, but low loss thin films for solar energy cells. All these developments in nanotechnology will require new knowledge in related materials and device applications. Thus, the training of students in the nanotechnology aspects of engineering for the next decade will present a major challenge in college level engineering education.\n \n\nAdmission Requirements\nMinoring \nCurriculum \nAccreditation \nContact Information\nDhonglu Shi\n493 RHODES Hail\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0072\n513-556-3100\nshid@ucmail.uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nEngineering\nNatural Science & Math\n\nProgram Code: 20MIN-NENG-MIN"

These products, be it a machinery or device, are usually comprised of engineering materials. Thus, an essential component of any engineering project is materials science and engineering, regardless of the discipline involved.\n\nEngineers with a background in materials science invariably find enhanced professional growth, and demonstrate greater versatility and employability. This is aptly illustrated by job listings in the state of Ohio, in which “Materials Engineering” is the second most common keyword after “Mechanical Engineering”. These numbers reflect a nationwide trend, as shown by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which projects a 9% annual growth rate for positions in materials engineering over the next decade. A program of study in materials engineering is thus increasingly relevant in any engineer’s educational experience and as a valuable, career-boosting component of a professional CV.\nAdmission Requirements\nMinoring \nCurriculum \nAccreditation \nContact Information\nDonglu Shi\n493 RHODES Hall\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0072\n(513) 556-3100\nshid@ucmail.uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nDesign\nEngineering\n\nProgram Code: 20MIN-MTEN-MIN"

The goal of the program is to make students aware of opportunities for careers in research. These opportunities are for outstanding first-year students to work with leading CEAS research faculty in their faculty labs during the summer after their first year in CEAS.\n\nThe program initially included five to six students per year but in 2016, the program was expanded to eleven students and included research at industrial and governmental partners. The program has been administered by a committee of senior faculty members (J. Boerio, T. Mantei, and R. Huston)\n\n\nLearn more about undergraduate research\n\nFor more information concerning Protégé, contact:\nDr. James Boerio, f.james.boerio@uc.edu\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Protege program enhances the student experience by having them learn to conduct research, work as part of a team, keep laboratory notebooks, write reports, and make presentations.\n\nIn addition, students are paid at the rate of $15.00 per hour for 40 hours of work each week between 12-15 weeks in the summer. The length of the program is at the discretion of the mentor, 12 week being the minimum.\n\nThe opportunity allows students to determine if they wish to pursue a co-op position and career in research. At the same time, participating industrial and governmental partners have an early opportunity to recruit highly talented and motivated student researchers.\n\n\nSelection Process\n\nEach spring, first year CEAS students who performed at a high level during the autumn semester are identified by a CEAS faculty committee. Most participating students have grade point averages of 3.75. Students are interviewed to determine interest in research careers and availability to work in Cincinnati or at the location of an industrial or governmental partner over the summer.\n\nInterviews are conducted by the CEAS faculty committee and by participating partners in which a diverse groups of students are selected.\n\n\nExpectations\nReport for work at appropriate times\nLearn as much as possible about your project\nShow interest in and enthusiasm for the project\nDo good research\nParticipate in professional development workshops offered by UC\nSubmit a short mid-summer report\nSubmit a short final report\nParticipate in final symposium\nDon't work more than forty (40) hours per week!\nContact Dr. James Boerio, (f.james.boerio@uc.edu) if there are any problems\nTypes of Research Projects\n\nResearch projects that are involved with the Protege program must advance the state of knowledge or understanding in a particular field. Students do not usually define the project and are defined by the mentors. These are not make-work projects. Protege students usually contribute to an important, larger project that are usually funded by some agency or industry that are important to the company.

The organizers are grateful to everyone that helped and contributed including the judges from universities and the North American Fuzzy Processing Society (NAFIPS) that all have fuzzy logic/AI expertise, UC, NAFIPS, and this year’s sponsor Thales. We’re excited to build on this to create an even better experience next year and drive this to be an ongoing competition to engage students and push the boundaries of explainable, Fuzzy-based AI. Also congratulations to all of the students that participated this year. They worked hard and developed exciting solutions in a very limited time. Without further ado, the winners for each prize for the competitions are as follows: \n\nOverall \n\n1st place: Team Asimov – Wesley Bumpus, Kate O’Grady, Lester Roberts \n2nd place: Harry Stamper’s Crew – Sam King \n3rd place: Team HeiTerry – Daniel Heitmeyer, Matthew Terry\n\nOther Awards\n\nMost Explainable Award: Harry Stamper’s Crew – Sam King \nMost Innovative Award: Team Asimov – Wesley Bumpus, Kate O’Grady, Lester Roberts \nMost Computationally Efficient Award: Team Asimov – Wesley Bumpus, Kate O’Grady, Lester Roberts\n\nCongratulations again to the teams! \n\nView team’s controller’s in action. Check out the summary and breakdown of the performance of the teams.\n\nIntroduction to the Challenge\n\nOne of the biggest issues facing widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industry is the transparency of the decision-making process. Many AI systems are being used with the sole objective of maximizing both accuracy in the prediction and computational efficiency. However, the value of the explainability of these systems is often underestimated. Explainability, in part, refers to the human interpretability of the processes and predictions given by the system. The more explainable a certain algorithm is, the simpler it will be for a human to understand or explain the underlying reasoning. When it comes to critical decisions, humans expect the basis of those decisions to be such that they are easy to verify and corroborate.\n\nIn this challenge, teams of 2-6 students constructed an explainable AI system based on Fuzzy Inference Systems to play the Python arcade game “Asteroid Smasher”. The challenge took place throughout the 2021 Spring semester and culminated in a virtual competition where student-created AIs played game scenarios created by the organizers. The AIs/teams were scored on several criteria including performance during competition, explainability metrics, etc. Winners  received monetary prizes after the competition (details below).\n\nWhat teams learned\nThe importance of an Explainable AI algorithm\nDifferent techniques for gradient-free optimization, such as Genetic Algorithms\n\nApplication of all of these towards development of an AI agent that can play the game “Asteroid Smasher”\nThe Challenge\n\nThe teams created fully autonomous XAI algorithms, in Python, that were able to play the Python Arcade Game “Asteroid Smasher”. In the game, a 2-dimensional spacecraft moves to avoid collisions with numerous asteroids that appear. The asteroids have different shapes, sizes and velocities. The spacecraft also has a weapon that can shoot straight ahead. If the projectiles emitted reach any of the target asteroids, they break into smaller pieces. The smallest asteroid pieces disappear after being hit by a projectile. A control system must consider all the different features of the system and determine the movement and shooting decisions of the spacecraft. \n\nThe teams' code had three main parts:\n\nThe platform (main python script) for the Asteroids Arcade Game. This is given to the teams. It refers to all the different background commands and functions that the game needs to work. It has different sections empty that teams filled with their own code in order to make it work. \nThe Fuzzy Inferencing System (FIS). This is the primary ‘brain’ of the XAI, a set of if-then rules that decide how the spacecraft moves. The organizers held a session to teach how to code a simple FIS for a different problem, so the teams had the knowledge needed to develop their own FIS and integrate it in the challenge.\nThe Optimization Process. This refers to the way in which the FIS is trained. AI requires a preliminary process called “training”, where the algorithm is exposed to training data/scenarios and its parameters are modified in order to achieve the best “score” possible according to some objective function. One particularly powerful type of optimization algorithm is Genetic Algorithms (GA). GAs are based on Darwinian principles of evolution and survival of the fittest. Through the competition, a free lecture was provided to the participants on this topic. The teams  used GAs or other applicable types of optimization algorithms in order to train their Fuzzy Systems to learn to play the game. There were no restrictions on the learning methods including manual tuning.\n\n \n\nWho was able to participate?\n\nThe challenge was open to all undergraduate and graduate university students. The format of the challenge was such that it complemented the skills of students enrolled in STEM degrees, but is was not limited only to STEM majors.  \n\nTimeline\n1/19/2021: Competition Kick-Off\n\nOnline meeting where we will go through the challenge and have 2 guest speakers from industry discussing the importance of explainability and the future of Fuzzy AI. Details on how to join the meeting and the time will be sent to the participants after registration.\n\n1/21/2021: Seminar: Fuzzy Inference Systems\n\nThis will be a recorded online session where we go through all the necessary steps to understand how to build a Fuzzy AI system. More information will be sent closer to the event by email.\n\n1/31/2021: First Deliverable Submission Due Date\n\nThe teams will need to use the concepts learnt in the first seminar to build their own solution of a simplified real-world problem using Fuzzy AI. The details of the problem will be given during the first seminar. Guidance in the development to those teams that request it will also be granted. This milestone will contribute to final team scores.\n\n2/1/2021: Seminar: Genetic Algorithms and other gradient-free optimization algorithms\n\nIn a similar format to the first class, a lecturer will walk you through the mechanics and implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). We will also discuss the use of a GA in the optimization of a FIS. Other gradient-free optimization algorithms will also be discussed. The students will then need to apply these concepts in their second problem. \n\n2/14/2021: Second Deliverable Submission Due Date\n\nThe teams will need to use the concepts learnt in the Optimization seminar to optimize a Fuzzy Inference System. Details on the problem will be given at the end of the seminar. Guidance can be provided as requested by teams and submissions will count towards final evaluation scores.\n\n2/15/2021: Introduction to the Asteroid Smasher game\n\nIn this meeting the Asteroid Smasher game will be introduced including constraints and details on controller development. Final details on the competition will also be given at this time including scoring metrics, expectations, and other final deliverables/requirements.\n\n4/4/2021: Final Deliverable – Asteroid Smasher Fuzzy XAI Submission Due Date\n\nThis will be the submission date of the final version of your Fuzzy XAI controller for the Asteroid Smasher game. Details on submission format and requirement will be given to you beforehand by the organizers. The final week between the submission date and the competition date will be used to ensure any issues are resolved. Submissions must be received by 11:59 PM EST. \n\n4/10/2021: Competition Livestream Event\n\nFinally, after all the hard work, the students and advisors will be recognized in this final event that will take place virtually. Teams will have the opportunity to describe what they did and their approach to creating their Fuzzy XAI systems. Then they will see their creations be put to the test in a series of scenarios created by the organizers. The teams will be scored and awards will be given out based on numerous criteria. \n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nFuzzy System deliverable\nOptimization deliverable\nFinal Asteroid Smasher Fuzzy XAI performance: Agents will be evaluated against a portfolio of scenarios with a custom fitness function\nExplainability of the created AI\nCreativity in the solutions\nAwards\n\nThere were several awards for the winners and for those who show creativity in their submissions! Monetary awards were given to the top 3 teams based on their overall competition score:\n\nFirst place: $1400\nSecond place:$900\nThird place $400\n\nAdditionally, the following awards were granted ($100 each): \n\nMost Explainable Solution\nMost Innovative Solution\nMost Computationally Efficient AI\nJudges\n\nThank you to our Judges!\n\nBarnabas Bede PhD, Associate Professor; Program Director Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Machine Learning; Department Chair of Mathematics; DigiPen Institute of Technology\nAlex Gonzalez, Research Assistant at Purdue Computer and Information Technology\nXiaonan(Shannon) Jing.

Advanced intelligent hardware devices and software currently make it possible to design elegant and sophisticated autonomous robotic devices whose capabilities far surpass older purely electro-mechanical automation systems. These systems will often be connected to the internet or allow some type of remote monitoring, and thus they will be vulnerable to various types of cyber-attacks. These systems must be made reliable, safe, and secure.  \n\nIn order to advance the state of the art for such systems, this program provides students specialized training in a number of disciplines, including computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, systems engineering, and project management. Students are exposed to the broad set of topics they need to envision new systems, while allowing them to develop the multidisciplinary set of skills they need to build these reliable, safe, secure, and trusted systems of the future.\n\nThe Master of Engineering (MEng) program provides a graduate degree that focuses on the practice of engineering in order to better serve working professionals. Rather than culminate in a research experience and a thesis, the Master of Engineering curriculum provides skills and expertise that enhance the individual’s ability to contribute to the technical workforce. The difference between the traditional Master of Science degree and the MEng degree is not on the rigor of the coursework or a lack of competencies, but rather on the focus of the curriculum.  \n\nThe program provides advanced training to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise. Depending on a student’s interest, the degree could add significant depth to an individual’s understanding of the practice of engineering or the program could be constructed to focus on greater interdisciplinary breadth if that is the educational objective of the student. In today’s competitive technology environment, industries need to have highly skilled practicing engineers who are flexible in their professional capabilities. The MEng program is a practice oriented, focused degree and caters to this need.\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nUndergraduate degree in engineering, engineering technology or computer science from an ABET accredited program with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better.  Individuals who do not meet those requirements may be considered by submitting additional materials that demonstrate their ability to be successful in a graduate program.\n\nGraduation Requirements \nInternational Student Requirements \nCurriculum \nAccreditation \nContact Information\nGraduate Studies Office\nPO Box 210077\n665 Baldwin Hall\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0077\n(513) 556-3647\nengrgrad@uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nComputers & Technology\nDesign\nEngineering\n\nProgram Code: 20MAS-RIAS-MENG"

Each student in a Research Group will be assigned one of these advisors. The student will keep this advisor until he/she has been accepted as a student by a permanent research advisor or changes the primary Group of association.\n\nChoosing a permanent advisor is one of the most important things a student will do, and so this choice should be made carefully, with both student and advisor taking into account the research interests and preparation of the student, the courses the student has taken in the College so far, and his/her performance in these courses, the research interests of the advisor, and the ability for student and advisor to interact successfully with one another.\n\nEach Research Group will provide opportunities for first-year students to learn about the work being done by the faculty in that area, usually through the Research Seminars. Students are also encouraged to make appointments with individual faculty members to discuss the faculty member's work and the prospects for the student's participation in that work. The student is responsible for completing all required courses and Ph.D. qualifying examination components necessary to obtain the degree he/she is working toward.\n\nA student may choose a permanent faculty advisor as soon as he/she wishes and the prospective advisor agrees. The choice should occur within 9 months of the student's entrance into the program. At the end of the Winter Semester of the student's first year in the program, students who do not yet have a permanent advisor will be asked to choose one. The Graduate Program Coordinator will facilitate this process. After consultation with the faculty involved, the permanent advisor will be assigned, with both advisor and student being informed in writing by the Graduate Program Director.\n\nChange of Advisor and/or Research Group\n\nOccasionally students may wish to change the Research Group of preference and/or the permanent faculty advisor. If the student is in good standing and has adequate preparation to work in the new area, and if the faculty of the new Research Group have room to accommodate new students, then a change can be made. The procedure is as follows:\n\nA student who does not yet have a permanent research advisor and a Research Group should submit a written request to the Graduate Coordinator to select his permanent research advisor and his Research Group membership. This request must be signed by the student and the faculty advisor. Irrespective of the temporary Research Group and temporary advisor affiliations of the student, this request will be granted. A student who already has a permanent research advisor should submit a written request to change the permanent advisor to the Graduate Coordinator. The Graduate Coordinator will inform the present and prospective advisors and the Research Coordinators of the advisors' Research Groups in writing of the student's request.\n\nAfter agreement between the present and prospective advisors and with the permission of the prospective advisor, the change will be made. The student, the previous advisor, and the new advisor will sign and date a form agreeing to the change. The form will also specify in detail any remaining work, which the student has to complete for the previous advisor, including any work for which the student has received a Research Assistantship, and any changes in financial aid to the student, which will be made as a consequence of the student's changing advisors. This form will be placed in the student's Department file and all those who signed the form will be given a copy. This process will be completed within one month of the date of the student's written request or else referred to the Graduate Council. Individual cases, which cannot be resolved according to the procedures in (a) or (b) will be referred to the Graduate Council for resolution.\n\nAdvisor for Part-Time Students\n\nPart-time students should follow the procedures listed above to find a permanent faculty advisor. Part-time students may initiate the procedure near the completion of their required course work. Students must have their faculty advisors chosen by the time they finish the course requirements for the degree.\n\n\nDuties of the Advisor\n\nWhile the student is encouraged to consult with other members of the faculty with regard to thesis/dissertation work, the faculty advisor has final authority and responsibility to guide the work as he or she believes appropriate. The procedures for formation of the MS thesis and Ph.D. dissertation committees are listed under Sections Error! Reference source not found. and Error! Reference source not found. respectively. The primary responsibilities of the faculty advisor are:\n\nDevelop a program of study in cooperation with the student. The faculty advisor has the authority for final approval of a student's program of study; however, the program must be in agreement with the rules and regulations of the EECS graduate program and must be approved by the Graduate Program Director.\nReview the student's progress, approve registration forms and add/drop or course withdrawal forms, and revise the program of study (if required) each registration period.\nSubmit recommendations (positive or negative) for financial aid for the student to the Graduate Program Director.\nForm the student's thesis/dissertation examining committee in consultation with the student and the Graduate Program Director.\nAssist and guide the student in the performance of the thesis/dissertation research.\nArrange the doctoral proposal defense; report the results to the Graduate Program Director.\nArrange the thesis/dissertation defense; report the results to the Graduate Program Director."

Rather than culminate in a research experience and a thesis, the Master of Engineering curriculum provides skills and expertise that enhance the individual’s ability to contribute to the technical workforce. The difference between the traditional Master of Science degree and the MEng degree is not on the rigor of the coursework or a lack of competencies, but rather on the focus of the curriculum.\n\nThe program provides advanced training to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise. Depending on a student’s interest, the degree could add significant depth to an individual’s understanding of the practice of engineering or the program could be constructed to focus on greater inter-disciplinary breadth if that is the educational objective of the student. In today’s competitive technology environment, industries need to have highly skilled practicing engineers who are flexible in their professional capabilities. The MEng program is a practice oriented, focused degree and caters to this need. While students have up to two years to complete the degree, all requirements can be completed in one year.\n\nAdmission Requirements\nGRE - Required of all international students; GRE is exempt for students that earned a degree from an ABET accredited university (or equivalent accreditation) in the USA with a GPA of 3.0+\nTranscript(s) and Degree Certificates (unofficial transcripts are used for admissions review, only admitted applicants submit official transcripts)\nGPA minimum 3.0 or equivalent \nStatement of Purpose\nTwo letters of recommendation\nInternational students - English Proficiency Test: TOEFL (minimum 92) or IELTS (minimum 6.5)\nCurriculum \nApplication Deadlines\n\nApplication deadlines and additional application information can be found at the CEAS Office of Graduate Studies.\n\nAccreditation \nContact Information\nGraduate Office\nPO Box 210077\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0077\n(513) 556-3647\nengrgrad@uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nComputers & Technology\nEngineering\n\nProgram Code: 20MAS-CS-MENG"

Support for students with laptops that do not meet these requirements will not be provided.\n\nAs an additional consideration, students are expected to use their laptops over the course of several years. Due to the nature of how laptops are used, an extended warranty may be a worthwhile option to consider.\n\nMacintosh Laptops\n\nThe College of Engineering and Applied Science Office of College Computing does not officially support Mac OS. If a student choses to purchase an Apple laptop, it should meet the similar specifications listed above or “MacBook and MacBook Pro (Apple) configurations 4 or 5” as published by the College of Design, Art, Architecture, and Planning (DAAP), link below. The relevant Macintosh specifications are on the third page of the linked PDF file, below. Additionally, they should be able to run Apple Bootcamp with Windows 10 Professional 64-bit for software that may require a Windows platform.  A Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI adapter will also likely be needed.  \n\nMac and MacBook Pro configurations "

Rather than culminate in a research experience and a thesis, the Master of Engineering curriculum provides skills and expertise that enhance the individual’s ability to contribute to the technical workforce. The difference between the traditional Master of Science degree and the MEng degree is not on the rigor of the coursework or a lack of competencies, but rather on the focus of the curriculum.\n\nThe program provides advanced training to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise. Depending on a student’s interest, the degree could add significant depth to an individual’s understanding of the practice of engineering or the program could be constructed to focus on greater inter-disciplinary breadth if that is the educational objective of the student. In today’s competitive technology environment, industries need to have highly skilled practicing engineers who are flexible in their professional capabilities. The MEng program is a practice oriented, focused degree and caters to this need. While students have up to two years to complete the degree, all requirements can be completed in one year.\n\nAdmission Requirements\nGRE - Required of all international students; GRE is exempt for students that earned a degree from an ABET accredited university (or equivalent accreditation) in the USA with a GPA of 3.0+\nTranscript(s) and Degree Certificates (unofficial transcripts are used for admissions review, only admitted applicants submit official transcripts)\nGPA minimum 3.0 or equivalent\nStatement of Purpose\nTwo letters of recommendation\nInternational students - English Proficiency Test: TOEFL (minimum 92) or IELTS (minimum 6.5)\nCurriculum \nApplication Deadlines\n\nApplication deadlines and additional application information can be found at the CEAS Office of Graduate Studies.\n\nAccreditation \nContact Information\nGraduate Office\nGraduate Studies Office\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0077\n(513) 556-3647\nengrgrad@uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nEngineering\n\nProgram Code: 20MAS-CE-MENG"

Over 220 capstone groups from CEAS showcased the projects they had been working on over the past year. ChE Team 5046-2321 received third place at the EXPO as well as first place by both the external judges from the Ohio Valley Section of Chemical Engineers and by the capstone teaching team.  It was a student-proposed project entitled, “Corn Stover Biomass and Zymomonas mobilis: An Environmentally Conscious Alternative to the Production of Ethanol Biofuel”.  The student group included graduating ChE seniors Shannon Batliner, Hannah Hitchings, Taylor Hudson, Rachel Muny, and Jenna Schniegenberg.  In their project, a scalable, efficient process to produce fuel-grade bioethanol from corn stover, a lignocellulosic biomass, was designed. The design of this process included pretreatment, detoxification, neutralization, and hydrolysis prior to fermentation.  Fermentation was to be carried out using the Zymomonas mobilis bacteria strain to convert sugars to ethanol. The ethanol was to be recovered through several continuous separation steps, using a beer column and two absorption columns. The economic analysis showed this process to be profitable, with $21.9 MM of annual raw material costs and $53.44 MM in annual revenue. The total capital investment for the process was $19.22 MM.  The projected return on investment was therefore about 40% with a payback period of 1.5 years based on the current ethanol price of $585/MT. Additional process development was recommended to optimize the process, thereby allowing it to run more efficiently, including further investigation to optimize the energy efficiency to save utility costs and understand more completely the growth of Z. mobilis.  The results of this design demonstrate that production of ethanol from corn stover can be commercially attractive.\n\nA group of environmental engineers took Judges’ Favorite at the CEAS EXPO as well as first place for their Environmental Engineering Capstone Project. Their team, Forefront Consulting, was composed of seniors Isabella Altier, Nabil Djafi, Rachel Hardtke and Josh McLelland.  Their work was entitled, “PFAS Removal Technology for the GCWW Charles M. Bolton Plant (CMBP)” and was sponsored by the Greater Cincinnati Water Works (GCWW).  Their project specifically entailed a literature review of possible treatment technologies for PFAS removal including granular activated carbon (GAC), anion exchange, reverse osmosis, and advanced oxidation. The four technologies were analyzed based on seven alternative analysis criteria including effectiveness, site feasibility, impact on the current treatment process, impact on necessary plant additions to meet the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule Revisions, waste stream produced, overall cost, and industry acceptance. From the alternative analysis, GAC was determined to be the best technology for CMBP. Once the technology was determined, the team designed a new separate GAC facility to remove PFOA and PFOS compounds to below 2 ppt. The facility included five GAC contactors, four operational and one for storage, and a backwash system. The new process at CMBP will intercept flow at the sand filter effluent and the water will be pumped to the new GAC building. Pumps were designed to meet the maximum flow capacity. After GAC treatment, the water would flow by gravity to the clearwell where chlorine and fluoride are dosed before distribution. The backwash process of the GAC filters would occur approximately every 10 days, with the backwash water going to the onsite sludge lagoon. Once the carbon in the GAC contactors becomes spent, it will be transported to the Richard Miller Treatment Plant (RMTP) on the Ohio River for reactivated with their incinerator. The total cost for this new design was estimated to be $25.7 million, which includes process materials, reactivation, earthwork, and labor and subcontracts. \n\nRead more: CEAS Expo showcases engineering capstone projects | University of Cincinnati (uc.edu) \n\nGraduate student Garima Mandavya, studying under Professor Patrick Ray, was offered a position in the inaugural IRiS Graduate Fellows Program for the 2023-2024 academic year.

One of the few such interdisciplinary advanced degree programs in the country, the BME graduate program offers four different areas of specialization - Medical Device Design, Medical Imaging and Regenerative Medicine. The degree provides students with the knowledge and tools to develop revolutionary healthcare devices, procedures, and treatment strategies for the 21st century. The field of biomedical engineering is expected to lead engineering employment growth in the next decade. \n\nThe Master of Engineering (MEng) program provides a graduate degree that focuses on the practice of engineering in order to better serve working professionals. Rather than culminate in a research experience and a thesis, the Master of Engineering curriculum provides skills and expertise that enhance the individual’s ability to contribute to the technical workforce. The difference between the traditional Master of Science degree and the MEng degree is not on the rigor of the coursework or a lack of competencies, but rather on the focus of the curriculum.\n\nThe program provides advanced training to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise. Depending on a student’s interest, the degree could add significant depth to an individual’s understanding of the practice of engineering or the program could be constructed to focus on greater inter-disciplinary breadth if that is the educational objective of the student. In today’s competitive technology environment, industries need to have highly skilled practicing engineers who are flexible in their professional capabilities. The MEng program is a practice oriented, focused degree and caters to this need. While students have up to two years to complete the degree, all requirements can be completed in one year.\n\nAdmission Requirements\nGRE - Required of all students\nTranscript(s) and Degree Certificates\nGPA minimum 3.0 or equivalent\nStatement of Purpose\nTwo letters of recommendation\nInternational students - English Proficiency Test: TOEFL (minimum 92) or IELTS (minimum 6.5)\nCurriculum \nApplication Deadlines\nAll applicants that apply to the BME graduate program by November 30, 2019 will be reviewed for the first round of fellowships and considered for a paid on-site visit to campus.\n\nApplication deadlines and additional application information can be found at the CEAS Office of Graduate Studies. \n\nAccreditation \nContact Information\nGraduate Studies Office\nPO Box 210077\n665 Baldwin Hall\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0077\n(513) 556-3647\nengrgrad@ucmail.uc.edu\n\n\nFind related programs in the following interest areas:\nEngineering\nMedicine & Health\n\nProgram Code: 20MAS-BME-MENG"

Simply fill out this form, send one to your instructor and one back to our office with your second assignment, and your instructor will send your final exam to the proctor. You will then schedule a time with your proctor to take the exam, and they will return the test to us.\n\n\nWho qualifies to serve as proctors? \n\nQualified proctors are: faculty members of a university or school system, clergymen, city officials, librarians, or similar professionals. To maintain integrity of the program, we do not permit fire chiefs and training officers within the fire department to serve as proctors.\n\n\nWhat types of assignments are given for distance learning courses?\n\nFor most of our distance learning courses, you will be required to complete three assignments. Each assignment contains several essay questions that are based on the assigned readings from your textbook(s) or Course Guide or additional web research. You will also be required to take a final exam or complete a final project which will be sent to a proctor of your choice.\n\n\nWhat is the tuition per credit hour?\n\nCurrent tuition rates and fees are regularly updated by the Bursar and subject to change.\n\nMost Fire Science courses are 3 credit hour classes.\n\n\nStudents enrolled full-time are charged at a flat rate (for most students, 12 to 18 hours) plus a per credit hour rate for any enrolled hours in overload status. Charges for hours in overload are subject to the refund policy.\nPart-time students are charged on a per credit-hour basis (exception are noted).\nIs financial aid available? Who do I contact for financial aid?\n\nYes, please contact the Financial Aid Office.\n\n\nHow do Residency Workshops fit into my degree program? \n\nWhile our residencies are strictly voluntary, these accelerated classes are designed so that students may complete a three-credit hour course in five full days. Students complete the same readings and assignments as you would for a regular 14-week distance-learning course. Many of our students have found that this is an excellent way to accelerate the completion of their degree while having an opportunity to network with other fire professionals throughout the country.\n\n\nDo your courses focus on training firefighters? \n\nNo, we are not a training program. Our courses are focused for company level and chief officer level in the fire service. Most of our students are currently firefighters seeking advancement or promotional opportunities within the fire service or are preparing for life after the fire service.\n\n\nWhat is the best way to contact the Fire Science Office? \nContact us UCFireScience@uc.edu\nUrraena Hoskins- Program Coordinator\n513-556-6583 \nurraena.hoskins@uc.edu\nLarry Bennett - Program Chair, Fire Science & Emergency Management\nlawrence.bennett@uc.edu\nCell: 513-470 2744\n\n\nFax Number: (513) 556-4856"

If the student later decides to move on to higher education, this experience is a great way to get an early understanding of what research is all about. \n\n\nUndergraduate Research Credits\n\nStudents who meet the requirements (see below) are encouraged to take Undergraduate Research credits (20-AEEM-5035) as part of their Technical Elective sequence for independent research work done in collaboration with an Aerospace faculty member. For information regarding possible research topics, look at the list of research facilities, look at faculty profiles, or speak to any of the Aerospace faculty members.\n\n\nPast Undergraduate Research Examples\nExpand AllCollapse All\nPath Planning for Multiple Land Surveying UAVs \nF.Li.D.S: Flying Liquid Dispersal System \nUAVs for Emergency Sample Collection in Hazardous & Inhospitable Environments \nAPOP Electric Propulsor \n\nUp to 3 credits of UG Research can be used for Technical Elective credit, and students may petition the Aerospace Curriculum Committee to use up to 3 additional semester credits of UG Research for Technical Elective credit. Approval of these petitions will depend primarily on the student's academic standing, the student's accomplishments in prior registrations for UG Research, and the recommendation of the faculty member who will supervise the additional research (whose signature must appear on the petition along with the student's signature).\n\n\nRequirements for UG Research credits:\nFull-time undergraduate status in \"good standing\" (no academic deficiencies) at Pre-Junior level or above.\nRegistration for AEEM-5035 for the appropriate number of credits (usually 3).\nAfter enrolling in AEEM-5035, students must access Blackboard then click on Course Syllabus for course information and then Course Documents to download the Undergraduate Research Proposal form. It can also be downloaded at the link below. This form must be typed, signed by the proposed faculty supervisor and delivered to Teresa Meyer in 745 Baldwin Hall for approval by the Department Head. We suggest this be done within the first two weeks of the start of classes. You will be notified within a few days if the proposal form is rejected by our Department Head.\nAt the end of the semester, a written report of the research must be turned in to the research advisor, and the student must present a public oral presentation on the research. Teresa Meyer in the Aerospace office will schedule these presentations. Sometimes due to scheduling conflicts, some of the presentations may be scheduled for early in the following semester, but only for students who are not graduating that semester."

It is recommended that the student take a course to satisfy the Math requirement from the Math Department. The approach a mathematician takes to solving problems is different from that of an engineer, and this difference is a worthwhile part of a student’s education. However, for scheduling purposes or because of a student’s background, certain engineering or other technical courses can count for Math credit.\n\n\nMS non-thesis option: 6 credits (2 courses) required, GE ACE students get 3 credits from B course. The list of substitute courses below can be used to satisfy the Math requirement. \n\nMS Thesis Option: 3 credits (1 course). Only the recommended and other approved math courses plus the courses in the substitute list with a star can count.\n\nPhD: 6 credits (2 courses) from a BS or 3 credits (1 course) from an MS. If two are required, then for one course, any math or substitute course can count. For the second course (or sole course if coming with and MS), only the recommended and other approved math courses plus the courses in the substitute list with a star can count. \n\nRecommended Math courses\n\nTypically in Fall Semester\n\n\nMATH6006 Numerical Analysis\nMATH6008 Applied Probability and Stochastic Processes\nMATH6012 Applied Linear Algebra\nMATH6051 Applied Ordinary Differential Equations\n\nTypically in Spring Semester\n\nMATH 6007 PDE and Fourier Analysis\n\nOther Approved Math Courses Especially for PhD students (both Fall and Spring) While those listed below are approved for Math credits, they are more theoretical and are generally taken by Math graduate students. Please check with your advisor before registering for any course listed below.\n\nMATH6001 Advanced Calculus I \nMATH6002 Advanced Calculus II \nMATH6003 Abstract Linear Algebra \nMATH6005 Introduction to Complex Analysis \nMATH7001 Complex Analysis \nMATH7002 Real Analysis \nMATH7004 Topology \nMATH7005 Ordinary Differential Equations \nMATH7006 Partial Differential Equations \nMATH7011 Advanced Mathematical Modeling \nMATH7073 Probability and Statistical Inference\n\nCourses generally approved for MATH substitution (MS non-thesis and only one of the PhD math classes, the starred courses can count for MS thesis requirement and second PhD course):\n\nTypically in Fall Semester\n\nAEEM 6015 Modern Control (see below)\nAEEM 6022 Optimal Control\nAEEM 7074* Advanced Finite Element Method \nBANA 6035 Simulation Modeling \nBANA 7031 Probability Models \nBANA 7041 Statistical Methods \nEECE 6019* Probability and Random Processes \nEECE 6024 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing \nEECE 6043 Optimization Methods and Models \nEECE 7033 Linear Systems Theory (see below) \nEGFD 7051* Numerical Methods in Aerospace Fluid Mechanics \nMECH 6060 Applied Fast Fourier Transforms \nMECH 7054 Boundary Element Methods \nMECH 7062 System Dynamic Analysis \nMECH 7090* Conduction Heat Transfer\nPHYS 7001 Mathematical Physics (must get approval for out of college course)\nSTAT 6021 Mathematical Statistics I STAT 6031 Applied Statistics I\nMATH 6015 Mathematical Programming\n\nTypically in Spring Semester\n\nBE 7061 Biostatistics in Research\nBE 7088 Regression Analysis\nBME 7061 Biostatistics in Research\nENVE 6027 Mathematical Principles of Environmental Systems\nMECH 6004 Monte Carlo Methods\nMECH 6011 Computational Design\nMTEN 6090 Molecular Modeling\n\nA special topics class that has a large Math content may also count. Much of this list comes from the Mechanical Engineering Department list, and it is appreciated.\n\nAEEM 6015 Modern Control or EECE 7033 Linear Systems Theory cannot count toward a Math requirement if Applied Linear Algebra is also taken for a Math requirement (possible for a non-thesis MS (not GE) or PhD student)"

The program was originally established in 1929 by Bradley Jones, an inventor and flight navigator who was most famously known for his record nonstop flight from McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio to East Boston Airport in Boston, Mass.\n\nUnder the guidance of Jones, and with the consultation of legendary flight navigator Orville Wright, a five-year program of study, with the first cooperative education experience within an aeronautical program, was developed. And despite the crumbling economy due to the effects of the Great Depression, UC’s program flourished.\n\nYears later, and quite serendipitously, while on assignment to work with the U.S. Army Engineering Division Laboratory to test high temperature alloy materials developed by a contractor for use in the nozzle of the Saturn V rocket, a professor by the name of Widen Tabakoff, PhD, forged a relationship with the University of Cincinnati that would continue for more than 50 years.\n\nWiden Tabakoff, PhD\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Tabakoff, the Aerospace program at the University of Cincinnati skyrocketed. He started a strong externally-funded research program that still continues today, and as head of UC's Center of Excellence in Propulsion, he also secured millions of federal funding and built the propulsion and gas dynamics laboratories and infrastructure.\n\n\nThrough Dr. Tabakoff’s collaboration with colleagues in astronomy, mathematics and physics, graduate studies in aerospace engineering were also established.\n\nThe mental agility and prowess which this rigorous program commanded earned attention from world-renowned aviators, scientists, and innovators alike,  including one of UC’s most famous faculty members Neil Armstrong, who taught at UC from 1971 until 1979, as well as from companies like General Electric Aircraft Engines in Evendale, Ohio.\n\nThanks to Dr. Tabakoff, and due to the cultivation of a special degree program specifically designed for employees of GE in conjunction with the co-op program called the Advanced Course in Engineering (ACE), thousands of advanced degrees have since been earned.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, Dr. Tabakoff passed away at the age of 95."

The program was originally established in 1929 by Bradley Jones, an inventor and flight navigator who was most famously known for his record nonstop flight from McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio to East Boston Airport in Boston, Mass.\n\nUnder the guidance of Jones, and with the consultation of legendary flight navigator Orville Wright, a five-year program of study, with the first cooperative education experience within an aeronautical program, was developed. And despite the crumbling economy due to the effects of the Great Depression, UC’s program flourished.\n\nYears later, and quite serendipitously, while on assignment to work with the U.S. Army Engineering Division Laboratory to test high temperature alloy materials developed by a contractor for use in the nozzle of the Saturn V rocket, a professor by the name of Widen Tabakoff, PhD, forged a relationship with the University of Cincinnati that would continue for more than 50 years.\n\nWiden Tabakoff, PhD\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Tabakoff, the Aerospace program at the University of Cincinnati skyrocketed. He started a strong externally-funded research program that still continues today, and as head of UC's Center of Excellence in Propulsion, he also secured millions of federal funding and built the propulsion and gas dynamics laboratories and infrastructure.\n\n\nThrough Dr. Tabakoff’s collaboration with colleagues in astronomy, mathematics and physics, graduate studies in aerospace engineering were also established.\n\nThe mental agility and prowess which this rigorous program commanded earned attention from world-renowned aviators, scientists, and innovators alike,  including one of UC’s most famous faculty members Neil Armstrong, who taught at UC from 1971 until 1979, as well as from companies like General Electric Aircraft Engines in Evendale, Ohio.\n\nThanks to Dr. Tabakoff, and due to the cultivation of a special degree program specifically designed for employees of GE in conjunction with the co-op program called the Advanced Course in Engineering (ACE), thousands of advanced degrees have since been earned.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, Dr. Tabakoff passed away at the age of 95."

UC-CEAS has a long-standing tradition of excellence and offers limitless opportunities in the engineering pedagogy. We invented cooperative education over 100 years ago, creating a transformative experience which fosters a sense of teamwork and achievement by our students. And so, most appropriately, JCI is the first institution in the US to form a joint venture with a Chinese university that exports cooperative education.\n\nOur unique experiential learning, combined with the strongest possible engineering curriculum, cultivates students of outstanding value to industry, as witnessed by our near 100% job placement rate for graduates. Additionally, UC was just ranked #1 for ROI (Return on Investment) out of all Ohio public universities and for CEAS graduates, the ROI is even higher. CEAS students are financially sound at the outset as their starting salaries range from $53,800 to $97,900 and their post-graduation earnings surpass college expenses by more than 30 times. JCI students will experience this success in its entirety.\n\nWith assistance from the Program Coordinator, Dr. Sherry Liao, and CEAS staff, I am responsible for the UC-CEAS side of operations for JCI. I envision a future in which both CQU and UC students develop long-lasting friendships and networks of talented colleagues.\n\nIt is my strong belief that this alliance, under the guidance of Dr. Chen and myself, will successfully spur the cooperative idea of education in China and create a brighter future in this ever-increasingly \"flat\" world of ours.\n\nThis alliance brings together two renowned universities, both leaders in their respective countries. Students enrolled in JCI receive the best of both worlds: a top-notch engineering education with degrees from each institution plus industry experience. These two assets combine to make JCI students high-demand graduates.\n\nThe Chongqing University and the University of Cincinnati are both at the forefront of revolutionizing engineering education.  This joint venture allows our top students to earn real-world work experience and two degrees after their study, a winning combination that places them far ahead of others upon graduation.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati’s vision for optimizing student success aligns perfectly with that of Chongqing University and our continued tradition of excellence: In 1952, the nationwide restructuring of higher education turned Chongqing University into an engineering-orientated multi-disciplinary university under the State Ministry of Education.\n\nIn May 2000, to meet the needs of higher education development in the 21st century, and to further enhance the university's overall strength, Chongqing University merged with Chongqing Jianzhu University and Chongqing Architectural College, forming a new Chongqing University. The University has since continued its previous disciplinary advantage in mechanical and electrical engineering, energy, material science, information technology, bioengineering—and the merger upgraded the new Chongqing University's academic status in China in the fields of architecture, civil engineering and environmental studies.\n\nToday, our University’s state-of-the-art labs and teaching facilities, innovative curriculum and training programs, and renowned faculty all fuse together, thus maintaining our prominent advantage in engineering disciplines.\n\nI am pleased to partner with the University of Cincinnati as it is a highly regarded institution which mirrors our value of education quality and excellence. We look forward to guiding these bright young minds on their journey to become the future leaders of our society.Replace with your text"

While the course provides content on culture, communication and working across cultures, it is in visiting another country that these topics are best appreciated and understood. Students who choose to go to Guatemala will experience a very different culture and a much different work culture than most have experienced. It is a visit students never forget.\n\nThe partnership with Guatemala is different and in some ways richer than our collaborations with other countries. The College has been working with the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala on efforts to increase participation of students in engineering. So in addition to the aspects of the global technical workforce are opportunities to interact and even help with encouraging local students to pursue engineering and other technical fields.\n\nWant to see what a student’s perspective of the trip?  Take a look at this short video of to see what you can experience in Guatemala.\n\nIndustry Visits\n\nVisiting industry allows students to hear from local representatives the challenges and opportunities faced with global business. Each link provides a description from a UC student describing what was learned on the industry visit.\n\nCoffee plantation\nPartner Universities\n\nUC and the College of Engineering & Applied Science have a strong partnership with UVG – the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. We work with UVG on STEM outreach and educational best practices. We are also exploring additional opportunities for visits and academic programs.\n\nUniversidad del Valle de Guatemala, UVG\nCultural Visits and Experiences\n\nGuatemala has a rich history, culture, and perhaps the friendliest citizens on the planet. There are Mayan ruins, active volcanos and traditional markets among other attractions. Students who have visited Guatemala have described their experiences in the following links:\n\nGuatemala Highlights\n\nAntigua (city)\n\nPanajachel and Lake Atitlan\n\nIximche\nGuatemala Highlights\nService Trip–The Orphanage\n\nProbably the most heart-warming experience of the trip came when the team visited an orphanage stowed away deep in the mountains of Guatemala. Working closely with students from UVG, the team assisted the orphans in a multitude of activities, including the comprehension of air/mass through the use of balloons and a balance, and the construction of different shaped objects through the use of plastic straws. Despite communication difficulties, the young beings were very excited about each and every project, and were very happy to “entertain” everyone that participated.\n\n\nUniversidad del Valle de Guatemala\n\nThe Global Technical Workforce, as per its namesake, is all about learning how other countries (and other cultures) do business in a professional, technical environment. While the team did not visit a large industrial site, they did have the opportunity to explore a “familiar” location, as they took a trip to La Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG).\n\n\nUVG Campus\n\nHere, the team toured the chemical, mechanical, and biology labs, and participated in a special luncheon where they interacted with personnel from the university. From one of the largest beetle collections in the world to CNC mold machines, this university had a whole lot to offer, as the team gathered an abundance of knowledge from this trip.\n\n\nEl Lago de Atitlan\n\nThe trip to El Lago de Atitlan was another highlight of the trip, as the students were able to experience a plethora of cultural phenomena that were unique to Guatemala. An exquisite lunch on the shores of the lake gave the students a great taste of local life, while the boat tour on the lake itself gave everyone an unprecedented view of the surrounding volcanoes. Furthermore, the group was able to peruse the markets of Santiago Atitlan, as they experienced, first-hand, the bartering system that the Mayans invoked upon their culture.\n\n\nThe Pacaya Hike\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of going to Guatemala has to be the fact that the students get to hike up an active volcano. The views are second to none, and being among/above the clouds is absolutely breathtaking. With the help of a local tour guide, the team endured the steep slopes of the volcano, while learning a portion of it’s history along the way. From roasting marshmallows in the natural heat of the mountain to clambering down it, Pacaya proved to be one of the highlights of the trip for both the students and the faculty, as many memorable moments were shared. \n\n\nPanajachel & Lake Atitlan\n\nLake Atitlan is a Guatemalan Lake that sits at just over 5,000 feet. The lake is an endorheic Basin which means that it does not drain into another body of water, such as an ocean. The lake is also the deepest lake in Central America and has a maximum depth of 1120 feet.\n\n\nLocated on the shores of the lake is the town of Panajachel, a center of trade in the area. Merchants line the streets offering various textiles and other hand made goods.\n\nThe local market here provides a great chance to experience business in a drastically different culture than that of the United States. No goods have a price tag and everything can be bartered for which can be a great experience.\n\nWhile much of Guatemala has long forgotten its Mayan heritage the town of Panajachel is still holding onto to its history. This can be seen from the dress of the local people to the goods that they sell. If you are looking for an opportunity to truly experience a unique culture first hand this is a great chance to do so.\n\nIximche\n\nVisit the Mayan Ruins of Iximche!\n\nIximche is a pre-columbian Mayan site located in Guatemala. It used to serve as the capital of the Kaqchikel Maya from 1470 – 1524. The structures were excavated from 1960 – 1972 and are now easily accessible to tourists. In the center, you will find two small plazas of temples, ceremonial platforms, and palaces where the capital used to be ran by wealthy Mayan families. The museum in Iximche also houses and displays sculptures made by the Mayan people, which will provide insight into the way they lived.\n\nThis experience will make you realize that we are all global citizens that have similar histories, even if we have different cultural backgrounds. As global citizens, it is our job to preserve the past and to learn from it to build our futures. Being a member of a world-wide community requires us to work together to build a community in the emerging world that respects the values and beliefs of all cultures.\n\nStudents should have this experience to expand their knowledge of the past and of Guatemalan culture. It is important to understand the beginnings of civilizations to grow our future. It is also important to understand the cultures of another country to remain aware of their beliefs and backgrounds when developing trust and friendships with them. In addition, diversity makes us more open-minded, smarter, and more creative, which will help students to grow as problem-solvers.  \n\nAntigua\n\nAntigua is the one of the pinnacles of going on this trip and experiencing the Guatemalan culture to its finest. Being the old capital of the country, Antigua offers some of the richest history there is in Guatemala. Through visiting Antigua I was able to learn a lot about what it means to interact with other cultures. For example, the way they approach shopping here is entirely different, as they use a bartering system, which I had to adjust to.\n\nThis experience has been truly eye opening. As someone who has never left the country, this was my first time being able to actually see what other cultures are like. The scenery is unlike anything I have ever seen before, the people are completely different and the activities we did will be unforgettable (when else will I get to climb a volcano and roast marshmallows in one of its steam pits?). I do not regret my time in Guatemala and neither would you if you decide to go on this trip."

Travelling provides the opportunity to apply this learning in an international setting. Students who choose to go to Germany will visit industry, partner universities, and cultural sites that are famous around the world.\n\n\nIndustry Visits\n\nVisiting industry allows students to hear from technical and organizational leaders regarding international business. Students learn from experts the challenges companies face and how they meet those challenges with a workforce able to contribute to the complex, global environment. Each link provides a description from a UC student describing what was learned on the industry visit.\n\nMTU Aero\n\nBMW\n\nSiemens\nPartner Universities\n\nUC and the College of Engineering & Applied Science have partnerships with several universities in Germany, including the ones described in the following links. Our partner universities provide opportunities for student exchange, collaborative degree programs, and collaborative research. Qualified students have the opportunity to spend an academic semester or two and perhaps a co-op semester at one of our partners. Check with your academic advisor or Prof Rutz if you are interested.\n\nTechnical University of Munich, TUM\nCultural Visits and Experiences\n\nCincinnati shares a rich history with Germany: Cincinnati’s Over the Rhine was settled by German immigrants who gave it that name because the canals reminded them of the area around the Rhine River; Cincinnati and Munich are sister cities, and Cincinnati has the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Munich. Students who have visited France have described their experiences in the following links:\n\nHiking the Alps\n\nMunich (city)\n\nMunich Technical Museum\n\nDoing Business with Germans\n\nGerman Food\n\nThe English Garden\nTechnical University of Munich\n\nWe visited the Technical University of Munich (TUM) Downtown Campus and Garching Campus. We went on a tour of both campuses and the TUM International Center Staff gave a presentation about their university to us.\n\nWe learned a lot about university life in TUM. Unlike in America, it is extremely hard to change majors in German universities. If a student did change majors, he/she would have to start from the first year of their new major, losing all the time he/she has invested in his/her previous major. Furthermore, classes in TUM are never graded on attendance, which is different from American universities where you could get in trouble or suffer repercussions if you skipped certain classes, depending on your professor. TUM also hosts a welcoming party to first year students, in which the President of TUM will serve and drink beer with the freshmen. Beer is a very integral part of German culture. This is very different from the strict policies American universities have about alcohol. We would never see a picture of our President Pinto drinking alcohol with freshmen.\n\nIn addition to school life in TUM, we also learned a lot about the education system in Germany. There is a huge emphasis and priority on STEM majors in Germany. People who have STEM majors and jobs are highly respected in society. The fact that Germany is known for its achievements in Science and Engineering could have added to this. Furthermore, the educational opportunities that a student has depends on how he/she performed as a ten-year-old. Based on their academic results in elementary school, students are placed in three different tracks for students headed for college, average or better white-collar positions, and trades and blue-collar jobs. Although it is possible to switch tracks, it is not very common. This is very different from America’s education system where students are not placed in different categories based on their performance when they were young.\n\nOther students should have this experience because it is a great opportunity to discuss and learn about education in another country, as well as be more aware of the education we have in America.\n\nBy Ilma Alfadila\n\nMTU Aero\n\nAre you interested in learning more about the metal tubes that fly in the sky? Don’t know what I’m talking about – Keep Reading!\n\nA Bundeswehr military aircraft located right outside of the MTU offices. The MTU logo can be seen on the tail of the craft.\n\nA visit to the MTU Aero Engines facility will be an experience like no other. You’ll have the opportunity to take a walk through the history of airplane engines in the one of a kind museum located on MTU’s grounds. This museum, only open to the public 4 days of the year, showcases mint condition engines and past products of MTU manufacturing. Some of the earlier engines are the last remaining exact replicas in the world.\n\nTake a tour of the manufacturing facilities, and get a taste of how MTU creates the pieces of the engine puzzle! Learn more about the manufacturing process, the people, and the machines. Want to learn more about the think tank behind these ideas? Ask about the 3-D printer room and hall of fame!\n\nPictured with our guide. L-R: Mr. Chritian Heinzelmaier (guide), Jon Hankenhof, Paige Sumser, Kari Cheek, Nathan Ashcraft, Emily Koschmeder, Ilma Alfadila, Prof. Jim Tappel, Hallie Grant\n\nTestimonial: My visit to MTU was eye opening. You see airplanes everyday, but its not everyday that you get to be this close to the engines, to really analyze the pieces or ask the professionals any questions that you might have. It is quite mind boggling to think that these small pieces are what helped you cross miles of land and sea to be where you are today. Thinking of how many people had to do research on the idea, before they had to present the idea, build a prototype, test the prototype, how many people had to design and build the machines that would make the products…I could keep going. It is amazing when you start to think of the process backwards; the complexity of the companies, the legality of production, product, and location, the costs associated with everything, the environmental aspect for the final product, the manufacturing facility, everything has to fit together or something could go wrong. Visits to manufacturing facilities help you realize that you are one piece in a HUGE puzzle. Everything you see or touch was created using meticulous processes that involves hundreds if not thousands of hours to create.\n\nEvery student should take this opportunity to visit another country and culture. You will make unforgettable friends, see landscapes and architecture that will leave you speechless, and eat foods that you will yearn for when you get back to the States. Immerse yourself in a place like no other. See the Alps, hear the language, walk the streets that were once roamed by Kings and Queens. Open your eyes to ideas that weren’t thought of before. Take this chance.\n\nPaige and Jon pose with the front of an engine fan. Jon is 6’2” and Paige is 5’7.\n\nA Bundeswehr military aircraft located right outside of the MTU offices.

We took a train from Munich into Kufstein early that Saturday morning. We walked to through the town to the trailhead of the Ebbs Kaisertal. We began our hike with a long stretch of steep stairs. The weather was great for the hike and we were pleasantly surprised as we were all prepared for rain. As we progressed up the mountainside, we passed several other hikers taking on the trails. One of the best parts of the hike was making it to the area shown in the photo below. Most of the trail was lined heavily with trees, but this spot was a clear view of the beautiful sights of the Alpine mountains lightly coated in snow. Needless to say, we all stopped for a photo opp. We then advanced a little further where there was a small chapel and a small lodge/restaurant to stop for some food. We had packed sandwich supplies and other snacks, so we sat and had a nice lunch break. Shortly after, we started the last leg of the hike and we came upon some snow. After another hour and several more pictures we made it to the Vorderkaiserfeldenhütte, where we found more kind travelers and an even better view of the mountains. We arrived there in the early afternoon and spent the next few hours hanging out in the hütte, playing some games, and relaxing. We also met a new friend, Laura. She was a 4-year-old girl who lives at the hütte with her parents who work there. We had a wonderful dinner and continued to chat and play games.\n\nThe next morning we had a traditional European breakfast at the hütte then hiked back down the mountain to Kufstein. It was a faster trip down, but I think we were all sorer from that part of the hike. We walked back to the train station, finding some ice cream and souvenirs along the way. We made our way back to Munich with sore legs and full hearts.\n\nI learned so much from this part of the trip, about our group and about being a global citizen. Communication is such a special and interesting thing that we share as people. I also learned that communicating with one another doesn’t just happen with the words we speak. Language was as clear challenge we faced not just during our trip to Kufstein, but throughout the trip. However, that didn’t stop us from learning and enjoying our time in Germany. This was very evident through our interactions with some of the hütte staff and Laura. We spent a long time with Laura playing and chatting, even though we didn’t speak the same language. This helped me to remember to be more empathetic and open in future situations of communication with others from around the world that have different cultures and languages.\n\nThis was such an amazing experience; I would definitely recommend this type of trip to any UC student even considering it. We got to experience the beauty and challenge of hiking in the Alps and meet new people. This was just one highlight of a great 10-day trip. This is an ideal length of time to spend in a small area of a new place that is so rich in opportunity and culture. Being exposed to a new part of the world helped me to realize that there is so much left to experience. I hope others will take advantage to opportunities like this offered to them at UC. I can’t wait for my next adventure!\n\nBy Karina Cheek\n\nDoing Business with Germans\n\nWe visited the Technical University of Munich (TUM) Garching Campus and the TUM Center for Key Competencies. This Center provides workshops to develop soft skills of students and teaches about conflict resolution, creativity methods, presentation techniques, inter-cultural communication and team work. It aims to prepare students for a successful start in business lives since soft skills are expected when they enter the workforce. We participated in a ‘Doing Business with Germans and Americans’ Workshop in a small group setting with one other German student.\n\nWe learned a lot about Germany culture such as how Germans are very conservative, orderly, timely, blunt, direct, detail-oriented, logical, efficient, and traditional. In addition, we discussed about how they work in a formal work setting, prioritize a clearly defined work-life balance, and separate their friends from their colleagues. We compared these characteristics with those of American culture and realized how different Germany and America was. In comparison, Americans prioritized personal relationships, emotions, freedom and individualism more than Germans. These discussions opened our minds and made us realize how big the world is and how different people and life is in different parts of the world. I also appreciated that there is always something good to learn from every culture, such as we can learn from how efficient the Germans are and how personal Americans are.\n\nOther students should have this experience because it is a great opportunity to discuss about culture with other German students to get an outsider’s perspective. It is also a chance to apply what we learned in ‘The Global Technical Workforce’ class.\n\nBy Ilma Alfadila\n\nMunich Technical Museum\n\nOn our cultural day, I elected to go to the Munich Technical Museum. This was an all-morning event as it encompassed decades of technological advancements in countless topic maters. We toured the museum at our leisure and explored how technology was innovated over the years. We looked at aviation, ocean transportation, power generation, environmental, machinery, musical instruments, and many more topics.\n\nThis visit taught me that innovation is never complete. Each iteration of a piece of technology was thought to be the most advance, the best, and the pinnacle. But without doubt, that product (a masterpiece in it’s time) was surpassed with a better, more efficient version. Engineers and other technical people kept working towards innovation. Furthermore, a lone worker developed none of these technologies. It takes teams of workers years to develop such innovation and more often than not, especially in today’s workforce, these teams require global collaboration.\n\nIf the team isn’t inherently global, the impact sure is. The items in this museum all had such a global impact. Whether it be bettering the world’s environment through population and carbon-usage tracking or uniting the world through global transportation over land and sea, the impact of these technologies had and continue to have an incredible global presence. When developing these technologies, you are not an employee of a company or an individual researcher; you are in service for the whole world. The entire globe will feel the impact of your work.\n\nArt museums are nice and very introspective, but a technical museum is something completely different. I would highly recommend attending a technical museum at some point to see first hand where our technology began and just how far we have come in such a short period of time. It will open your mind to the thought that innovation is never finished.\n\nBy Ilma Alfadila"

Students took a train from nearby Bordeaux to St. Emilion and were allowed to explore the countryside and town before meeting for a tour of the city.\n\nThe countryside is gorgeous and boasts vineyards as far as the eye can see. The vineyards, which were first planted in the 2nd century by the Romans, remain the main tourist attraction at St. Emilion.\n\nThe city of St. Emilion, however, is perhaps more gorgeous than the vineyards themselves. Built with limestone found in the region, St. Emilion has touches of Roman influence and is a very historic city, having been shaped from the 2nd century through the Middle Ages to the present day. The city was a very important city throughout history because of the limestone, the wine, and its location on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. It got its name from a monk named Emilion, who, in the 8th century, was said to perform miracles. In order to escape persecution, Emilion fled to a cave in the present day city, and the town became to be known as St. Emilion.\n\nThe largest attraction in the town of St. Emilion is the monolithic church, which is carved into the limestone beneath the giant bell tower shown in the picture on the right. The church was constructed in the 12th century and also contains ancient catacombs and medieval drawings inside.\n\nThe guided tour of St. Emilion was fascinating, as students learned about the historical significance of St. Emilion, as well as the region’s history of wine production.\n\nAround one million people visit St. Emilion each year to experience the history, culture, and wine the region has to offer. Few cities in the world are able to combine gorgeous countryside with breathtaking architecture like St. Emilion. In addition, the history of St. Emilion makes it one of the most unique places in France.\n\nThe combination of the history and views that St. Emilion has to offer make it a place everyone should try to visit.\n\nBy Adam August"

Seeing how intensive their engineering programs are was interesting because they can work on a lot of hands on projects. Also, getting to meet and become friends with many of the students at the University of Lorraine was something that I will never forget. The international affairs director at their university was wonderful, and put on so many evets for us, and even got us a meeting with the mayor of the town of Nancy. I would recommend that everyone come on this trip because it’s a way to experience a different culture, and make new friends who you never knew existed.\n\n\nBy Ray Recchia"

In the U.S., we are so used to having cars to take us everywhere. Most of Europe uses public transportation, so becoming familiar with the system is important if you plan on traveling around the world. There are also various benefits to the European public transportation system for a college student who wants to live abroad, such as not needing a car, being able to travel far distances for cheap, contributing to less pollution into the environment, and sitting in less traffic.\n\n\nPublic Transportation\nMy Rewarding Experience\n\nA few friends and I decided to travel to Versailles during one of our free days, which is about an hour outside of Paris. This was the first time we followed the metro lines without guidance from our faculty leader. Once we got to Versailles, the best feeling was knowing that we could navigate through France ourselves. I felt more independent and global, and I think everyone should experience this, especially for those who are planning to live abroad.\n\n\nTypical Methods of Transportation & Cost Per Voyage:\n\nEurail (train): ~6€\n\nMetro/RER: ~2€\n\nBus: ~2€\n\nTram: ~2€\n\nBenefits:\n\nNo need for a car\n\nAffordable for a college student\n\nBetter for the environment\n\nLess traffic\n\nBy Cayley Severino"

It houses over 70,000 pieces of art spread out over more than 650,000 square feet. This enormous building houses paintings, drawings, sculptures, and many other relics from years long gone. To make their vast collection more manageable, the Louvre is divided into 8 departments:\n\nNear Eastern Antiquities\n\nEgyptian Antiquities\n\nGreek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities\n\nIslamic Art\n\nSculptures\n\nDecorative Arts\n\nPaintings\n\nPrints and Drawings\n\n\nAmong the vast collection on display at the Louvre, you will find a few that stand out from the crowd. These ultra-famous pieces of art include the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the Great Sphinx of Tanis.\n\nIn addition to all the impressive art the Louvre holds, the building itself is not to be ignored. Originally constructed as a fortress in the 12th century, its grand rooms and vast hallways will inspire awe in anyone.\n\nVisiting the Louvre was a humbling experience for me. I gained a much better appreciation and understanding of nations around the world and of thousands of years of history. I was in awe at the talent of so many people and cultures that came before me. Visiting the Louvre is a great way to better understand your place in the world and appreciate the people and cultures of history.\n\nIf you are studying abroad anywhere in Europe, a day at the Louvre is a must do. Paris is easily reached by the train from all parts of Europe due to its central location. Admission is 15€, but all European students get in free. So be sure to bring your visa or a European student ID to get into the Louvre completely free! (A Bearcat ID or other American student ID will not work) The Louvre is also free on the first Sunday of each month, if you’re not afraid to battle large crowds.\n\nThis glorious museum is well worth your time, so plan your trip now to see the largest collection of art in the world!\n\nà bientôt!\n\nBy Emma Mullins"

Not only is this restaurant one of the oldest in Paris it is also where we had our last dinner as a group together in Paris. The food was delicious and the server even took a selfie with us. La Mère Catherine has outside seating across from the restaurant itself. Inside the restaurant they also have live music. On this night they had a wonderful individual singing La Vie En Rose. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming and part of me did not want to leave. The area that houses La Mère Catherine has many shops, restaurants, and bars most of which have live music. If you are a lover of music France is the place to be.\n\n\nChez le Pépère\n\nChez le Pépère is a small yet lively establishment that is located across from the Adigao Hotel in Bordeaux. If you have your windows open in the Adigao you can hear the band playing faintly which is how I found this wonderful place. They have a bar with a few tables when you walk in from the street. When you go down the spiral staircase you will find an intimate space where the band plays. I happened to be there in a Tuesday which is there Jazz night. The area was packed and people kept coming. Despite the small space a couple started to dance in the style known as Lindy Hop. The Band was fantastic and the atmosphere was even better. The staff was happy to be there and if you let him the owner would talk with you all night. If you do one thing in Bordeaux you should visit Chez le Pépère.\n\nBy Roxana Richter"

Along with these features, you can’t forget the grand canal which is nearly 60 acres big.\n\nThe Palace of Versailles is open every day of the week except Monday, and at an affordable price. More than 3 million people visit the chateau each year, and you should be one of them. Get to the castle early, and plan to spend as much time as possible. Stay there the whole day and you still won’t see the entire place. Not only is the castle beautiful, but it is also rich in history. The staff at the palace is embracing, and excited to share their information and get to know you.\n\nNext time you are in France make sure to visit one of the most famous palaces in the world. Go with some friends, prepare to walk a lot, and go get lost in the history and gardens!\n\nBy Ben Harnen"

Although Saint Émilion and the surrounding country side is primarily known for the miles of vineyards and numerous chateaus, the town first came to prominence with the construction of the Monolithic Church that was carved into the heart of the town. On top of the Church stands a 53-meter-high bell-tower that offers gorgeous views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nSaint Émilion first began in the eighth century when Monk Émilion took up residence in the area. He made his home in a small cave, performed miracles, and acquired a following of monks. When he died, a larger chapel was built on top of his home to hold the growing number of residents. Around the 12th century, the Monolithic Church was carved into the nearby hillside to attract individuals on pilgrimages and to benefit from the export of limestone. Unfortunately, most of the decorations on the inside of the church were destroyed during the French Revolution.\n\n\nSaint Émilion and its Monolithic Church were by far my favorite experience while in France. During a tour of the Church, our group was told that only a small percentage of tourists come to Saint Émilion to see the Church—most come for the wine. It was wonderful to learn more about such an important element of the town, especially because it is something the locals take great pride in. It should me that being a global citizen isn’t just about doing the “tourist attractions,” but about learning about what makes up the city and what made it important in the first place. I feel this is especially important in countries like France that have such rich histories.\n\nBy Samantha Bauman"

The Eiffel Tour is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.\n\nThe Exposition Universelle of 1889 marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. This exposition is intended to showcase nation’s achievements. A monument was to be built serving as the exposition’s entrance in Paris. More than 100 plans were submitted to win this great honor, but the firm of Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel was chosen.\n\nGustave Eiffel was a renowned engineer and architect known for his metal structural work, including the internal frame of the Statue of Liberty. Although he did not himself create the designs for the Eiffel Tower, his name gave the city the confidence that this tower would be a successful masterpiece.\n\nThere were many Parisians unhappy with the idea to erect such an eye sore in the center of the city. A petition was signed against the tower from 300 artists, sculptors, and architects, representing the 300 meters height of the tower. Alas, construction continued, and the tower was completed within 2 years 2 months and 5 days.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was not meant to be a permanent structure; after 20 years it was to be dismantled. The tower was saved by using it for scientific purposes. Eiffel installed a meteorology lab at the top of the tower and invited scientists to conduct their research on fields from gravity to electricity. Due to its height, the tower was ideal for wireless telegraph transmissions, which aided the French in World Wars I and II. The Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world until the construction of the Chrysler Building in 1930. Gustave Eiffel had also included a small apartment at the top of the tower in which he welcomed colleagues and his doctor brother saw patients with respiratory ailments.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was built in order to welcome other nations to a universal exposition. The spirit of demonstrating our great pieces of work across the globe still exists today. It is important to recognize that people in all industries, including engineering, have worked globally since travel was possible. As globalization ever more increases, so will the drive to work with other creative minds in all corners of the world.\n\nBy Bethany Caspersz"

We were welcomed into the University of Lorraine with a small party of French appetizers and a chance to mingle with French engineering students currently attending the university. The students and faculty of U. Lorraine welcomed us with open arms and made our very first experiences in France extremely positive, and all of Nancy was the same way!\n\nThe center of town is a beautiful square called Place Stanislas, which includes a collection of ornate and historic buildings. In the center of the square is a statue of a Polish man, Stanislas, who commissioned the building of the square to honor Louis XV. Surrounding this statue are the buildings mentioned above, which include the Hotel de Ville (City Hall) as well as cafés, restaurants and small shops. On any given day, the square was crowded with locals and tourists alike, admiring the architecture, soaking up the sun, or enjoying a bite to eat.\n\nJust outside the square, is the stunning Basilica of St. Epvre, and beyond this is the Parc de la Pépinière, a large park full of vibrantly colored flowers, benches perfect for a short rest among the gardens, and people walking, jogging, and playing. Within the park is also a free zoo! That was a strange concept for us, but we had fun wandering around the exhibits to see the donkeys, peacocks, birds, ducks, and monkeys.\n\nOther experiences in Nancy included a guided tour of the city led by students from the University of Lorraine and a meet and greet with the Mayor of Nancy! Cincinnati and Nancy are sister cities, so the Mayor was excited to have us visiting and a gracious host.\n\nTime spent with the French engineering students gave us UC students an opportunity to learn about the education system of France, which was somewhat different from our own. We learned that the students in France graduate from high school then enter into two years of preparatory education to prepare them to be engineers. This is two years of math and physics, and all the students said these two years were extremely difficult and nothing but work. After this, the students go into an engineering specialization and complete three more years of schooling. At the end, they will have the equivalent of a bachelors and masters degree in their engineering specialty. Further, meeting the French students gave us a unique opportunity to speak openly with them about cultural similarities and differences as well as to just connect as humans and students and realize how much we all had in common.\n\nTruly, Nancy was not only a gorgeous city, but also the people were all welcoming and generous, and these experiences started our entire trip off on a high note! Experiencing the city on foot and learning some of its history from the locals gave us an appreciation for the culture and a love of the people.\n\nBy Kristina Ulm"

The Paris Gare Du Nord branch is located between two of Europe’s most popular train stations, Gare du Nord and Gare de l’Est. There are large gender specific rooms with POD beds that have curtains to provide extra privacy, a space to lock up luggage, electronic key cards, community wash rooms, and a laundry room. There is a restaurant bar on the main floor that provides entertainment and food and drink discounts to the guests.\n\n\nOur Visit\n\nThe nineteen of us who attended the study abroad and stayed in the hostel had a wonderful time. We were comfortable in our rooms, they were full but spacious enough, and very clean. It was fun to have everyone together in a room for our last couple of days after having gotten to know each other throughout the trip. It was very helpful that the hostel was located so close to public transportation services, and the free breakfast that was offered to our group was simple but tasty and much appreciated.\n\n\nBased on the decorations, and language used on the signs, the hostel was clearly catered towards young adults. Many of us enjoyed being in the hostel’s restaurant, especially on Cinco de Mayo because there were games, food and drink specials, live mariachi bands, and dancers. The hostel houses young adults from all around the world, so it was very exciting to meet and get to know people from all over Europe and the U.S. It was a great first hostel experience for all of us. For those of the students who have plans to travel Europe again, this hostel will be a great international resource.\n\nBy Leah Rutz"

For those of the students who have plans to travel Europe again, this hostel will be a great international resource.\n\nBy Leah Rutz\n\nNancy\n\nOur first stop in France was the lovely and welcoming city of Nancy, located West of Paris, about two hours from the German border. We were welcomed into the University of Lorraine with a small party of French appetizers and a chance to mingle with French engineering students currently attending the university. The students and faculty of U. Lorraine welcomed us with open arms and made our very first experiences in France extremely positive, and all of Nancy was the same way!\n\nThe center of town is a beautiful square called Place Stanislas, which includes a collection of ornate and historic buildings. In the center of the square is a statue of a Polish man, Stanislas, who commissioned the building of the square to honor Louis XV. Surrounding this statue are the buildings mentioned above, which include the Hotel de Ville (City Hall) as well as cafés, restaurants and small shops. On any given day, the square was crowded with locals and tourists alike, admiring the architecture, soaking up the sun, or enjoying a bite to eat.\n\nJust outside the square, is the stunning Basilica of St. Epvre, and beyond this is the Parc de la Pépinière, a large park full of vibrantly colored flowers, benches perfect for a short rest among the gardens, and people walking, jogging, and playing. Within the park is also a free zoo! That was a strange concept for us, but we had fun wandering around the exhibits to see the donkeys, peacocks, birds, ducks, and monkeys.\n\nOther experiences in Nancy included a guided tour of the city led by students from the University of Lorraine and a meet and greet with the Mayor of Nancy! Cincinnati and Nancy are sister cities, so the Mayor was excited to have us visiting and a gracious host.\n\nTime spent with the French engineering students gave us UC students an opportunity to learn about the education system of France, which was somewhat different from our own. We learned that the students in France graduate from high school then enter into two years of preparatory education to prepare them to be engineers. This is two years of math and physics, and all the students said these two years were extremely difficult and nothing but work. After this, the students go into an engineering specialization and complete three more years of schooling. At the end, they will have the equivalent of a bachelors and masters degree in their engineering specialty. Further, meeting the French students gave us a unique opportunity to speak openly with them about cultural similarities and differences as well as to just connect as humans and students and realize how much we all had in common.\n\nTruly, Nancy was not only a gorgeous city, but also the people were all welcoming and generous, and these experiences started our entire trip off on a high note! Experiencing the city on foot and learning some of its history from the locals gave us an appreciation for the culture and a love of the people.\n\nBy Kristina Ulm\n\nEiffel Tower\n\nBuilt in 1889, it is still the tallest building in Paris and the most visited paid for monument in history, seeing nearly 7 million people per year. The Eiffel Tour is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.\n\nThe Exposition Universelle of 1889 marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. This exposition is intended to showcase nation’s achievements. A monument was to be built serving as the exposition’s entrance in Paris. More than 100 plans were submitted to win this great honor, but the firm of Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel was chosen.\n\nGustave Eiffel was a renowned engineer and architect known for his metal structural work, including the internal frame of the Statue of Liberty. Although he did not himself create the designs for the Eiffel Tower, his name gave the city the confidence that this tower would be a successful masterpiece.\n\nThere were many Parisians unhappy with the idea to erect such an eye sore in the center of the city. A petition was signed against the tower from 300 artists, sculptors, and architects, representing the 300 meters height of the tower. Alas, construction continued, and the tower was completed within 2 years 2 months and 5 days.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was not meant to be a permanent structure; after 20 years it was to be dismantled. The tower was saved by using it for scientific purposes. Eiffel installed a meteorology lab at the top of the tower and invited scientists to conduct their research on fields from gravity to electricity. Due to its height, the tower was ideal for wireless telegraph transmissions, which aided the French in World Wars I and II. The Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world until the construction of the Chrysler Building in 1930. Gustave Eiffel had also included a small apartment at the top of the tower in which he welcomed colleagues and his doctor brother saw patients with respiratory ailments.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was built in order to welcome other nations to a universal exposition. The spirit of demonstrating our great pieces of work across the globe still exists today. It is important to recognize that people in all industries, including engineering, have worked globally since travel was possible. As globalization ever more increases, so will the drive to work with other creative minds in all corners of the world.\n\nBy Bethany Caspersz\n\nSaint Émilion Monolithic Church\n\nSaint Émilion is a small, breathtaking town in southern France, just outside of Bordeaux. Although Saint Émilion and the surrounding country side is primarily known for the miles of vineyards and numerous chateaus, the town first came to prominence with the construction of the Monolithic Church that was carved into the heart of the town. On top of the Church stands a 53-meter-high bell-tower that offers gorgeous views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nSaint Émilion first began in the eighth century when Monk Émilion took up residence in the area. He made his home in a small cave, performed miracles, and acquired a following of monks. When he died, a larger chapel was built on top of his home to hold the growing number of residents. Around the 12th century, the Monolithic Church was carved into the nearby hillside to attract individuals on pilgrimages and to benefit from the export of limestone. Unfortunately, most of the decorations on the inside of the church were destroyed during the French Revolution.\n\n\nSaint Émilion and its Monolithic Church were by far my favorite experience while in France. During a tour of the Church, our group was told that only a small percentage of tourists come to Saint Émilion to see the Church—most come for the wine. It was wonderful to learn more about such an important element of the town, especially because it is something the locals take great pride in. It should me that being a global citizen isn’t just about doing the “tourist attractions,” but about learning about what makes up the city and what made it important in the first place. I feel this is especially important in countries like France that have such rich histories.\n\nBy Samantha Bauman\n\nPalace of Versailles\n\nThe Palace of Versailles is open every day of the week except Monday, and at an affordable price. More than 3 million people visit the chateau each year, and you should be one of them. Get to the castle early, and plan to spend as much time as possible. Stay there the whole day and you still won’t see the entire place. Not only is the castle beautiful, but it is also rich in history. The staff at the palace is embracing, and excited to share their information and get to know you.\n\nNext time you are in France make sure to visit one of the most famous palaces in the world. Go with some friends, prepare to walk a lot, and go get lost in the history and gardens!\n\nBy Ben Harnen\n\nPublic Transportation  \n\nTraveling Through France\n\nGetting around through France, as well as the rest of Europe, is both easy and cost effective. You will find a travel station in nearly every city, and travel maps are always easily accessible. Just choose a method (i.e. Eurail, metro/RER, bus, tram) and off you go to see all the wonderful sights!\n\nWhy You Should Have This Experience\n\n\nNavigating through a foreign city is a huge step in becoming a global citizen, especially in Europe. In the U.S., we are so used to having cars to take us everywhere. Most of Europe uses public transportation, so becoming familiar with the system is important if you plan on traveling around the world. There are also various benefits to the European public transportation system for a college student who wants to live abroad, such as not needing a car, being able to travel far distances for cheap, contributing to less pollution into the environment, and sitting in less traffic.\n\nMy Rewarding Experience\n\nA few friends and I decided to travel to Versailles during one of our free days, which is about an hour outside of Paris. This was the first time we followed the metro lines without guidance from our faculty leader. Once we got to Versailles, the best feeling was knowing that we could navigate through France ourselves. I felt more independent and global, and I think everyone should experience this, especially for those who are planning to live abroad.\n\nTypical Methods of Transportation & Cost Per Voyage\n\nEurail (train): ~6€\n\nMetro/RER: ~2€\n\nBus: ~2€\n\nTram: ~2€\n\nBenefits\n\nNo need for a car\n\nAffordable for a college student\n\nBetter for the environment\n\nLess traffic\n\nBy Cayley Severino\n\nThe Louvre\n\nThe Louvre, located in the center of Paris, is one of the most impressive and extensive collections of art in the world. It houses over 70,000 pieces of art spread out over more than 650,000 square feet. This enormous building houses paintings, drawings, sculptures, and many other relics from years long gone. To make their vast collection more manageable, the Louvre is divided into 8 departments:\n\nNear Eastern Antiquities\n\nEgyptian Antiquities\n\nGreek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities\n\nIslamic Art\n\nSculptures\n\nDecorative Arts\n\nPaintings\n\nPrints and Drawings\n\n\nAmong the vast collection on display at the Louvre, you will find a few that stand out from the crowd. These ultra-famous pieces of art include the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the Great Sphinx of Tanis.\n\nIn addition to all the impressive art the Louvre holds, the building itself is not to be ignored. Originally constructed as a fortress in the 12th century, its grand rooms and vast hallways will inspire awe in anyone.\n\nVisiting the Louvre was a humbling experience for me. I gained a much better appreciation and understanding of nations around the world and of thousands of years of history. I was in awe at the talent of so many people and cultures that came before me. Visiting the Louvre is a great way to better understand your place in the world and appreciate the people and cultures of history.\n\nIf you are studying abroad anywhere in Europe, a day at the Louvre is a must do. Paris is easily reached by the train from all parts of Europe due to its central location. Admission is 15€, but all European students get in free. So be sure to bring your visa or a European student ID to get into the Louvre completely free! (A Bearcat ID or other American student ID will not work) The Louvre is also free on the first Sunday of each month, if you’re not afraid to battle large crowds.\n\nThis glorious museum is well worth your time, so plan your trip now to see the largest collection of art in the world!\n\nà bientôt!\n\nBy Emma Mullins\n\nJazz Clubs\n\nJazzers\n\nNancy’s only jazz piano bar Jazzers is a piano bar that is right off the square in Nancy. On the 1st floor guest can enjoy a beverage. There is also a piano available for guest to play when there is not band playing in the basement. Jazzers is cozy with a staff who enjoys every moment.\n\nLa Mère Catherine\n\nLa Mère Catherine was founded in Paris in 1793. Not only is this restaurant one of the oldest in Paris it is also where we had our last dinner as a group together in Paris. The food was delicious and the server even took a selfie with us. La Mère Catherine has outside seating across from the restaurant itself. Inside the restaurant they also have live music. On this night they had a wonderful individual singing La Vie En Rose. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming and part of me did not want to leave. The area that houses La Mère Catherine has many shops, restaurants, and bars most of which have live music. If you are a lover of music France is the place to be.\n\nChez le Pépère\n\nChez le Pépère is a small yet lively establishment that is located across from the Adigao Hotel in Bordeaux. If you have your windows open in the Adigao you can hear the band playing faintly which is how I found this wonderful place. They have a bar with a few tables when you walk in from the street. When you go down the spiral staircase you will find an intimate space where the band plays. I happened to be there in a Tuesday which is there Jazz night. The area was packed and people kept coming. Despite the small space a couple started to dance in the style known as Lindy Hop. The Band was fantastic and the atmosphere was even better. The staff was happy to be there and if you let him the owner would talk with you all night. If you do one thing in Bordeaux you should visit Chez le Pépère.\n\nBy Roxana Richter\n\nUniversity of Lorraine\n\nThe part of the university we got to tour was the engineering college\n\nWe got to hangout and make friends with many of the students at the university\n\nIt helped me realize the differences between our education system and student lifestyles.\n\n\n\nOther students should experience this because it gives a better understanding of the French culture of students our age. Seeing how intensive their engineering programs are was interesting because they can work on a lot of hands on projects. Also, getting to meet and become friends with many of the students at the University of Lorraine was something that I will never forget. The international affairs director at their university was wonderful, and put on so many evets for us, and even got us a meeting with the mayor of the town of Nancy. I would recommend that everyone come on this trip because it’s a way to experience a different culture, and make new friends who you never knew existed.\n\nBy Ray Recchia\n\nSt. Emilion\n\nThe region is primarily known for its red wine and is home to dozens of chateaus that produce some of the most expensive wine in the world. Students took a train from nearby Bordeaux to St. Emilion and were allowed to explore the countryside and town before meeting for a tour of the city.\n\nThe countryside is gorgeous and boasts vineyards as far as the eye can see. The vineyards, which were first planted in the 2nd century by the Romans, remain the main tourist attraction at St. Emilion.\n\nThe city of St. Emilion, however, is perhaps more gorgeous than the vineyards themselves. Built with limestone found in the region, St. Emilion has touches of Roman influence and is a very historic city, having been shaped from the 2nd century through the Middle Ages to the present day. The city was a very important city throughout history because of the limestone, the wine, and its location on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. It got its name from a monk named Emilion, who, in the 8th century, was said to perform miracles. In order to escape persecution, Emilion fled to a cave in the present day city, and the town became to be known as St. Emilion.\n\nThe largest attraction in the town of St. Emilion is the monolithic church, which is carved into the limestone beneath the giant bell tower shown in the picture on the right. The church was constructed in the 12th century and also contains ancient catacombs and medieval drawings inside.\n\nThe guided tour of St. Emilion was fascinating, as students learned about the historical significance of St. Emilion, as well as the region’s history of wine production.\n\nAround one million people visit St. Emilion each year to experience the history, culture, and wine the region has to offer. Few cities in the world are able to combine gorgeous countryside with breathtaking architecture like St. Emilion. In addition, the history of St. Emilion makes it one of the most unique places in France.\n\nThe combination of the history and views that St. Emilion has to offer make it a place everyone should try to visit.\n\nBy Adam August"

For my first two co-op rotations I worked for GE Aviation. I gained valuable insight on working for a larger company. For my third co-op rotation, I worked as a research intern locally for the Greenacres Foundation in Cincinnati doing agricultural and ecological research. For my last rotation, I worked for the Wendell lab at UC and assisted with a project with the Ohio Department of Transportation. I learned about the research process, and it made me realize I wanted to commit to a career in this field. Had it not been for these co-ops, I would not have realized what my true career goals are.” \n\nCo-op Experiences\n\nGE Aviation – Clearwater, FL\nGE Aviation – Long Island, NY\nThe Greenacres Foundation – Cincinnati, OH\nThe University of Cincinnati, Wendell Lab – Cincinnati, OH\n\n \n\nVladimir Miskovic '23\n\nMechanical Engineering\nNovi Sad, Serbia\n\n“I completed all five of my co-op rotations at Leoni wiring systems. I stayed with Leoni because they gave me a lot of different opportunities in different roles and travel opportunities. During my third rotation I moved to North Carolina, where I worked with Caterpillar as well. The two aspects of co-op that I found most valuable were the opportunities to work on real world problems and the connections I’ve made.” \n\nCo-op Experiences\n\nLeoni Wiring Systems – Columbus, IN; Raleigh, NC; and Braga, Portugal\n\n \n\nRebecca Gilligan '23\n\nMechanical Engineering, ACCEND M.S. in Aerospace Engineering\nCincinnati, Ohio\n\n“For three of my four co-ops, I was at UC’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Multi-Agent Systems Technology Research (UAV MASTER) Lab doing unmanned aerial vehicles research. I found with this co-op that I really enjoy research. It gave me a chance to be hands on, but to also direct what I was learning and what I was working on. Research co-ops are worth it because of all the experience you get. I’ve had the freedom and the opportunity to take projects from the start and advance them very far. I’ve learned systems engineering, flight testing, systems design, and much more. The research co-ops have set me up very well for my graduate program and beyond.” \n\nCo-op Experiences\n\nU.S. Naval Research Laboratory – Washington, D.C. \nUC Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Multi-Agent Systems Technology Research (UAV MASTER) Lab – Cincinnati, Ohio\n\n \n\nRickey Terrell '19\n\nChemical Engineering\nMason, Ohio\n\n“I loved getting the opportunity to work on research projects for both of my co-op experiences. All of the work that I was completing was integral in producing a final product and it made me feel like I was a valued employee instead of just a co-op student. Both experiences also helped me become comfortable with failure in a scientific environment.

I am constantly challenged with intriguing problems and have gotten the opportunity to work on complex projects. The mentality of “we treat you like a full-timer” is the reason I continued to return to Marathon for more co-op terms. One of my favorite aspects about Marathon is that I’ve had the freedom to rotate between different locations and departments. In my most recent co-op I was able to work in the business side of engineering, which is something I see myself going into long term.

Successful co-ops often lead to a job offer before you graduate.\n\nYou get a temporary glimpse of a job in your field to determine what you like and dislike. If a co-op experience isn't what you're looking for in a career, you have two to four more co-ops to learn what interests you.\n\nMy co-op rotations helped me land my full-time position before graduation and I couldn’t be more thankful! Through my experiences, I learned about different departments that I love and others that I’d rather not continue in — learning what I didn't like prior to graduation was very helpful.\n\n Ali Ziegler\nBiomedical Engineering, '22\n\nWhat does a co-op schedule look like?\nTypically, your schedule will include:\n35+ hours per week\n15–18 weeks (semester)\nOn site, remote, or on-campus\nWhere can I co-op?\n\nAnywhere you want! Choose to stay close to home, in Cincinnati, or travel the globe. Choose a research co-op here at the college or work for businesses and organizations, including Fortune 500 companies. Our students often work for:\n\nApple\nEthicon Endo-Surgery\nGE Aviation\nL'Oréal\nMesser Construction\nMicrosoft\nProcter & Gamble\nRivian\nSiemens\nTesla\nToyota\n\nCheck out our student co-op stories or learn more about where our students often work for their co-op rotation. \n\nHow do I find a co-op position?\n\nEvery CEAS student is assigned a co-op advisor who will help coach you through the job search process. Just like finding any job, you'll submit an application, follow an interview process, and negotiate your offer. Tools like Handshake and services such as the Bearcat Promise Career Studio will help you find your co-op and prepare your application materials. \n\nHow does co-op work?\n\nYour schedule will alternate semesters in the classroom with semesters spent working full-time in a chosen field. Typically, you'll complete between three and five co-op semesters prior to graduation, which is equivalent to 1.5 years of job experience to put on your resumé!\n\nWhy is co-op essential to an engineer's education?\n\nIt's important to learn how to work with people and understand the business side of being an engineer. Dr. Weidner says co-op is more important than ever to an engineering education.\n\nLearn more about co-op from current students!\n\nIf you're ready to explore what co-op is like, follow our Instagram to see current students takeover to share their co-op experience and what it's like to be a CEAS student!"
